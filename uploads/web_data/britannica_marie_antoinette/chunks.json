As the story goes, it was the queen\u2019s response upon being told that her starving peasant subjects had no bread. Because cake is more expensive than bread, the anecdote has been cited as an example of Marie-Antoinette\u2019s obliviousness to the conditions and daily lives of ordinary people. But did she ever actually utter those words? Probably not. For one thing, the original French phrase that Marie-Antoinette is supposed to have said\u2014\u201cQu\u2019ils mangent de la brioche \u201d\u2014doesn\u2019t exactly translate as \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d It translates as, well, \u201cLet them eat brioche.\u201d Of course, since brioche is a rich bread made with eggs and butter, almost as luxurious as cake, it doesn\u2019t really change the point of the story. But the queen wouldn\u2019t have been referring to the sort of dessert that English speakers often imagine. More important, though, there is absolutely no historical evidence that Marie-Antoinette ever said \u201cQu\u2019ils mangent de la brioche\u201d or anything like it. So where did the quote come from, and how did it become associated with Marie-Antoinette? As it happens, folklore scholars have found similar tales in other parts of the world, although the details differ from one version to another. In a tale collected in 16th-century Germany, for instance, a noblewoman wonders why the hungry poor don\u2019t simply eat Krosem (a sweet bread). Essentially, stories of rulers or aristocrats oblivious to their privileges are popular and widespread legends. The first person to put the specific phrase \u201cQu\u2019ils mangent de la brioche\u201d into print may have been the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau . In Book VI of Rousseau\u2019s Confessions (written about 1767), he relates a version of the story, attributing the quote to \u201ca great princess.\u201d Although Marie-Antoinette was a princess at the time, she was still a child, so it is unlikely that she was the princess Rousseau had in mind. Since Rousseau\u2019s writings inspired the revolutionaries, it has sometimes been supposed that they picked up on this quote, falsely credited it to Marie-Antoinette, and spread it as propaganda, as a way to rouse opposition to the monarchy. However, contemporary researchers are skeptical of such claims, having found no evidence of the quote in newspapers, pamphlets, and other materials published by the revolutionaries. Amazingly, the earliest known source connecting the quote with the queen was published more than 50 years after the French Revolution. In an 1843 issue of the journal Les Gu\u00eapes , the French writer Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr reported having found the quote in a \u201cbook dated 1760,\u201d which he said proved that the rumor about Marie-Antoinette was false. Rumor? Like so many of us, he was probably just repeating something he had heard.
