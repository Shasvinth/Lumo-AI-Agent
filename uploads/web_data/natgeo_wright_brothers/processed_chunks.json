Photograph by Archive Pics, Alamy Right : Wilbur Wright wrote a letter to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, requesting information about aeronautics to help him and Orville with their aircraft designs. Photograph by New York Times Co., Getty Images The Wright brothers were interested in flying from a young age. As children in Dayton, Ohio , their favorite toy was a small helicopter-like object that was powered by a rubber band to twirl its blades. Fascinated by the toy and its mechanics, the brothers hoped to one day build a flying machine big enough to hold them both. Before experimenting with airplanes, the Wright brothers ran a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Photograph by RGB Ventures, SuperStock, Alamy Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. As young men, the brothers went into business together, first operating a printing press, then a bicycle repair shop. Eventually the duo began selling their own custom-made bicycles to customers. But the brothers never lost their love of flying. At the time, other aircrafts such as gliders\u2014or aircrafts without engines\u2014did exist, but the Wrights wanted to add more power to the objects they were flying. In 1899 the brothers began experimenting with building their own aircrafts. UP, UP, AND AWAY In 1900 the brothers traveled from Ohio to Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to begin their flight experiments. The oceanside dunes at Kitty Hawk had regular breezes and soft, sandy landing surfaces\u2014perfect for their studies. The brothers first conducted tests with kites before experimenting with gliders. Both Orville and Wilbur separately piloted the gliders during their testing process. Wilbur Wright (right) and an unidentified friend assist Orville as he pilots a glider.

In 1903 the brothers built an airplane called the Wright Flyer I, which featured wooden propellers the men had designed and carved themselves. The plane also had a gasoline engine. After weeks of unsuccessful attempts, the craft\u2014with extra fabric incorporated to increase the stiffness of the wings\u2014took flight for 12 seconds on December 17, 1903, traveling 120 feet before landing. The plane worked! Both brothers flew the craft a few more times that day. They had flown the world\u2019s first successful piloted engine-powered airplane.

The decades following Kitty Hawk were filled with accomplishments in aviation, including the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean and the first passenger flight. And, of course, flight didn\u2019t just stay in this world\u2014a little over 65 years after the Wrights\u2019 famous first flight, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon .
