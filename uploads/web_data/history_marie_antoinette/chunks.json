By: History.com Staff European History Did Marie-Antoinette Really Say \u2018Let Them Eat Cake\u2019? History.com Staff Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images Published: October 24, 2012 Last Updated: February 18, 2025 Print Copy It\u2019s one of the most famous quotes in history. At some point around 1789, when being told that her French subjects had no bread, Marie-Antoinette (bride of France\u2019s King Louis XVI) supposedly sniffed, \u201cQu\u2019ils mangent de la brioche\u201d\u2014\u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d With that callous remark, the queen became a hated symbol of the decadent monarchy and fueled the revolution that would cause her to (literally) lose her head several years later. But did Marie-Antoinette really say those infuriating words? Not according to historians. Lady Antonia Fraser , author of a biography of the French queen, believes the quote would have been highly uncharacteristic of Marie-Antoinette, an intelligent woman who donated generously to charitable causes and, despite her own undeniably lavish lifestyle, displayed sensitivity towards the poor population of France. That aside, what\u2019s even more convincing is the fact that the \u201cLet them eat cake\u201d story had been floating around for years before 1789. It was first told in a slightly different form about Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, the Spanish princess who married King Louis XIV in 1660. She allegedly suggested that the French people eat \u201cla cro\u00fbte de p\u00e2t\u00e9\u201d (or the crust of the p\u00e2t\u00e9). Over the next century, several other 18th-century royals were also blamed for the remark, including two aunts of Louis XVI. Most famously, the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau included the p\u00e2t\u00e9 story in his Confessions in 1766, attributing the words to \u201ca great princess\u201d (probably Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se). Whoever uttered those unforgettable words, it was almost certainly not Marie-Antoinette, who at the time Rousseau was writing was only 10 years old\u2014three years away from marrying the French prince and eight years from becoming queen.
