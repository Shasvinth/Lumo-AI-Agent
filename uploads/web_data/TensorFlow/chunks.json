TensorFlow 2 focuses on simplicity and ease of use, with updates like eager execution, intuitive higher-level APIs, and flexible model building on any platform. Many guides are written as Jupyter notebooks and run directly in Google\u00a0Colab\u2014a hosted notebook environment that requires no setup. Click the Run in Google\u00a0Colab button. Install TensorFlow Install the package or build from source. GPU support for CUDA\u00ae-enabled cards. Migrate to TensorFlow 2 Learn how to migrate your TF1.x code to TF2. Keras Keras is a high-level API that's easier for ML beginners, as well as researchers. TensorFlow basics Learn about the fundamental classes and features that make TensorFlow work. Data input pipelines The tf.data API enables you to build complex input pipelines from simple, reusable pieces. TensorFlow 2 best practices Learn about the best practices for effective development using TensorFlow 2. Save a model Save a TensorFlow model using checkpoints or the SavedModel format. Accelerators Distribute training across multiple GPUs, multiple machines or TPUs. Performance Best practices and optimization techniques for optimal TensorFlow performance.
