They implemented programs like education, distributing writings, lectures, and social service activities to spread Christianity. Missionary schools like LC, STC, and Trinity aimed to spread religion and inculcate Western culture in Sri Lankan society. Impact of Missionary Activities Education in English medium was compulsory for government employment, leading to a perception that those who followed Buddhism and Hinduism were \"heathens.\" Missionaries' service work, such as offering gifts to the poor and caring for the sick, helped them gain closer proximity to the people. Buddhist Revival By the end of the 19th century, a revival sparked due to the adverse impact of missionaries on Sri Lankan religions and the fear of cultural destruction. The Buddhist revival movement established pirivenas, printing presses, and Buddhist schools, and took steps to protect local cultures. Key Figures and Publications Notable Buddhist figures included Walane Siddhartha Thero, Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thero, and Rathmalane Sri Dharmaloka Thero. Publications included Lakmini Pahana, Sinhala Jathiya, Sarasavi Sandaresa, and Sinhala Bauddhaya. Debates and Education Bhikkhus, led by Migettuwatte Gunananda Thero, conducted public debates with missionaries, drawing large crowds. The great five debates took place between 1865 and 1873. Education was a challenge for Buddhists due to lack of funds and organizational skills, but key figures helped establish schools like Ananda, Dharmaraja, and Mahinda Vidyalaya. Hindu Revival Arumuga Navalar led the Hindu revival movement and started a newspaper called Udayabhanu.
