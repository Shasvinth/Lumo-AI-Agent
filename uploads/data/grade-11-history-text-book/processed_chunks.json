Yet, by the 19th century, the \ninfluence of the industrial revolution spread to the other countries in Europe and \nthe rest of the world. \nTrade was the major reason for the emergence of the industrial revolution in Europe. \nWhen the situation of Europe in the 18th century is analyzed, it can be seen that \nFrance, Portugal and Spain other than Britain engaged themselves in colonization \nand extensive trade.  Therefore, it is important to inquire into the reasons why such \na revolution began in Britain.\n\uf076 Reasons for the Emergence of the Industrial Revolution in Britain\nFinancial and commercial affairs started developing in Europe since the 16th century \nand by the 18th century, Britain had surpassed some of the other leading European \ncountries such as Holland, France, Portugal and Spain. As a result a wealthy class \nwho could invest money on industries was created in that country. At the same \ntime, there was a rapid growth in the population of Britain which resulted in a high \ndemand for goods and in turn producing goods to meet the increasing demand \nbecame a challenge.

At the same time, there was a rapid growth in the population of Britain which resulted in a high demand for goods and in turn producing goods to meet the increasing demand became a challenge. This led to a development in the industrial sector. Further, there was an expansion of the knowledge of science as a result of the Renaissance that took place in Europe in 14th and 15th centuries. This knowledge was used in producing- 2 -\nnew machinery. Minerals such as iron and steel that were necessary in producing \nmachinery too were found in Britain. Not only that  Britain easily found things like \ncoal which played a major role in producing energy.\nThough there was a heavy population in contemporary kingdoms such as France, \nthe development of trade in those countries was limited in comparison to Britain. \nBut, Britain had obstructed the commercial relationships of its colonies with other \ncountries in the world by imposing several commercial laws. Thus, Britain was \nable to maintain a high demand for their productions in its own colonies because \nthey had no other choice than importing those productions from Britain. Some of \nthose products with high demand in Britain were suitable for the production using \nmachines. One example is the high demand placed upon British cotton clothes \nby  India. Though there was an increasing demand for British cotton clothes, they \ndid not have the ability to increase the production within a short period with the \nexisting production methods. Because of the high demand that existed for the British \nproductions, there arose a need in increasing the production in a short period. It is \nas a solution to this challenge that there was a rapid development in the industrial \nfield. \nThere were several changes in the agriculture field too in contemporary Britain. \nThere, the rich landowners combined small pieces of land that belonged to poor \nfarmers and made large farms. This is termed as the \u201cencroaching movement.\u201d As \na result of this, the farmers who lost their land migrated to cities in search of jobs. \nThe extra labour that was generated as a result was able to be used for the industrial \ndevelopment.\nUnlike in other countries, in Britain talented individuals had the opportunity to earn \nmoney irrespective of their social status. This free social environment in the attitudes \nsupported the spread of novel ideas and it was conducive for the development of \nthe industrial sector. Further, together with the development of the economy, the \nemergence of new banks and financial organizations that provided capital for the \nindustries and businesses was seen. \nThe political stability that was prevailing in Britain too helped the industrial \nrevolution. The parliament provided the freedom, tax relief and support to engage \nin business activities for the economic development.\nCompared with the other countries in Europe, Britain had the most conducive \nenvironment for the industrial revolution.

Rise of  the Industrial Revolution \n The industrial revolution in Britain was based on three industries as given below. \n \uf034 Textile industry\n \uf034 Iron and steel industry\n \uf034 Coal industry\nThe development that occurred in these fields resulted in the gradual progress in \nother fields such as transport, communication and agriculture.\n\uf034Textile Industry\nFig 1.1 \u2013 The Jenny machine produced by James \n          Hargreaves for spinning cotton in 1764\nTextile producers in Britain faced a challenge of increasing their textile products to meet \nthe high demand that came from their own colonies. Weaving clothes became a little faster \nwith the invention of the flying shuttle by John K. in 1733. But the slowness in preparing \nthreads needed in weaving clothes still remained a problem. According to the situation that \nwas there at that time, threads produced \nby six thread makers per day were \nenough only for one weaver to work for \none day. Therefore, there was some idea \nof increasing the pace of spinning. As a \nresult of that enthusiasm, a person called \nJames  Hargreaves produced a machine \ncalled \u2018Jenny\u2019 in 1764 for cotton weaving. \nThis machine was a manually operated \none. Later in 1769, Richard Arkwright \nproduced a more efficient, water powered \nspinning wheel. It was named as \u2018water \nturbine\u2019. Arkwright\u2019s creation was an \nimportant production when compared \nto the other machines used for the same \npurpose in the past. But it was difficult to be used in houses because it was very big in size. \nOn the other hand, because a fast tide of water was needed to run the machine, it could be \nused only in such places where there was a continuous supply of water.\n",

Thus, \nwithin a period of about 30 years \nnew machines and novel technical \nmethods were invented to make \nspinning cotton more efficient. \nHence, there was a big revolution in \nthe weaving industry during a short \nperiod of time. \n\uf0ea ACTIVITY 1\n1.

Thus, as a result of the expansion of the \nindustrial revolution, there was a rapid change in all forms of transport; land, water \nand air transport.\nFig 1.11 Aeroplane produced by \nWright brothers\nFig 1.10  Daimler\u2019s motor car\n\uf076\ufffdExpansion of Communication Sector\nThere was a rapid development in communication sector too in parallel to the \ndevelopment in transport.

This left their land in villages uncultivated. The rest of the minor \nproprietors had to give up their lands due to various reasons.  Such small lands \ngiven up thus and the lands taken over from other farmers were combined together \nto make mega farms. Agriculture developed as a result of cultivating these lands \nwhich came under the encroaching movement. \nChange of crops in cultivation \nhelped  to   reduce   spreading \nof diseases and to increase \nproductivity. \nJethro \nTull \nintroduced \nthe \nline \nsowing \nmethod with horse tethered \nploughs. This method helped \nto reduce the number of seeds \nneeded for sowing and increase \nproductivity. \nFig 1.15  Cultivation using change of crops\nAt the same time, animal products increased due to the new technological methods \nused in animal husbandry. One example is the findings regarding breeding of sheep \nmade by Robert Bakewell. \nThe invention of efficient equipment that came with the industrial revolution \naltered the field of agriculture completely. Machines were produced to clear forests, \nprepare the land and produce seeds. Further, paying attention on producing manure \nto achieve more productivity in agriculture is an important move.

Expansion to other countries\nThe industrial revolution that began in Britain spread to the countries in the \nEuropean continent also within a short period of time. Later it went to Asian, \nAmerican and African continents also. There were several reasons for the spread of \nthe industrial revolution to other countries in the 19th century.\n\u2022 Increase in demand for goods that came as a result of rapid increase in world  \n \n population\n\u2022 Development of travel and transport in Europe\n\u2022 Discovery of coal in France and Germany \nAs a result, other countries in the world too started to speed up their production \nusing machines in the same way England did. Industrial centres emerged in areas \nthat were situated close to markets and where raw materials were found in abundance \nin Germany and France. Germany that was able to mark an increased industrial \ndevelopment, had become a powerful country at the beginning of World War I. \nThen the industrial revolution spread to other European countries like France, \nBelgium, Austria, Hungary and Prussia. The Austrian empire built roads to a length \nof 30000 miles and Belgium doubled the length of its roads at the same time. Then, \nevery country started laying railways. The effects of the industrial revolution were \nfelt in states in America that existed as colonies of Britain as well. There was a rapid \nindustrial development after independence in that country. \nJapan was an Asian country which had an enormous development in the industrial \nsector during the latter half of the 19th century and the first few decades of the 20th\ncentury. Japan has become a country that holds a competitive place among the \ncountries that have obtained a rapid development in science and technological fields \nby following the western methods and models. \nThe influence of the industrial revolution was greatly felt in many Asian countries \nincluding China, India and Sri Lanka by the 20th century. Thus the world became a \nglobal village because of the industrial revolution that spread to the other countries \nin the world and the rapid development it created in transport and communication \nfields.\n",

These \nresults had both good and bad characteristics. \n\uf076\ufffdChanges in the Political Field\nThe industrial revolution resulted in a wealthy class that invested money for profit \nand an underprivileged class that survived by selling labour. The rich exploited the \nlabour of the underprivileged in their businesses and earned a huge profit. Yet the \nliving conditions of the labourers who worked in factories were very poor. Because \nof this suppression there were many clashes between the rich and the poor including \nthe emergence of labour unions, boycotts, struggles for rights, etc. This situation \nended in the expansion of political beliefs such as  socialism and liberalism.   \nFig 1.16 - A struggle for rights by labourers\nAdam Smith presented the concept called \u201claissez-faire\u201d which led to the expansion \nof capitalism throughout the world.

At the same time, as the industrialization spread throughout Europe, there arose a need for getting raw materials for a cheaper price and selling the products at a higher prices. Therefore, the European countries had to compete- 14 -\nfor tightening their political grasp in the colonies.  This new imperialism which \ncame after 1850 is called neo-imperialism. This struggle of European countries to \ncapture new colonies became a major factor that led to World War I.\n\uf076 Changes in the Economic Sector\nOne change that took place in the industrial revolution is the expansion of \nindustrial products and commercial activities taking the first place in the economy. \nAccordingly, a wealthy class that owned factories and a class of business people \ngradually developed. Farmers who owned small lands had to come to cities and join \nthese factories as they could not carry on working in their farms. Because of that, the \nself-sufficient economy failed and emerged a working class that worked for a salary. \nThus, the agro-economic system broke down and the import-export economy came \nforward. Agricultural production too became industrialized and a number of food \ntypes came to markets. As a result, both local and foreign businessess developed in \nEuropean countries and Asian, African and Latin American countries which were \nthe colonies of European countries. In the same way, the capitalist economic system \ntoo spread rapidly around the globe.\nPrivate entrepreneurs could not afford to invest money on these expanded businesses \nindividually.  So, several entrepreneurs got together and formed combined business \ncompanies. These companies expanded their commercial activities into Asian, \nAfrican and Latin American countries with the help of their governments to achieve \ntheir targets.\nAt first, these trade companies consisted of local businessmen only. Yet, towards the \nfirst part of the 19th century, these companies became multi-national companies. \nThese companies that were engaged in production of goods and buying and selling \nsimultaneously were engaged in monetary and banking activities. This made \ntransactions and loan facilities easy for the entrepreneurs.\n\uf076 Impact on the Society\nThe society was influenced both positively and negatively due to the industrial \nrevolution. Many new cities were created as a result of the industrialization and \nthe lives of people who lived there were greatly affected. People could afford to buy \nthose items that were produced in bulk in the factories. At the same time these \nfactories generated a lot of new job opportunities. As a result people could enjoy \nbetter living conditions.\n",

The increasing number of job opportunities in cities \nthat emerged due to mega industries sped up the urbanization. \nOne major social outcome of the industrialization is the formation of a classed \nsociety.

This rich class consisted of two major \nfractions.\n\u2022 Aristocrats who owned lands\n\u2022 The other class consisted of middle class business owners, small scale traders, \n       factory owners, bankers, contractors, engineers and lawyers, etc. \nThey employed labourers for less wages and earned heavy profit through that.

Effects of  the Industrial Revolution on Sri Lanka\nHow the industrial revolution that started in Britain spread throughout the world \nwithin a short time has been explained above. Although the industrialization that \ntook place in Britain and other European countries did not take place in Sri Lanka \nin the 19th century, the effects of the industrial revolution could be identified from \nSri Lanka too. The major reason for that is, Sri Lanka being a colony of Britain \nwhen industrial revolution started. British people came to Sri Lanka and started \nmega scale cultivations. Many factories were started in connection to thus started \ncultivations such as tea, coconut, rubber and machines were imported from Britain \nto be used in those factories.\nImportant incidents of this period:\n\u2022 Starting of a mill to pound coffee by the governor, Fredric North in 1804 AD\n\u2022 Using machines for activities of tea factories such as drying, grading and exporting\n\u2022 Using machines to prepare rubber for exporting\n\u2022 Introduction of Macadam method to build roads in 1885\nThere was a need for manpower for the estates and   factories and the labour class \nwas formed by the people who worked there for salary. Landowners and factory \nowners became the affluent class and they organized themselves separately as a \nwealthy, educated middle class.  The capitalist economic system grew in Sri Lanka \nand import and export trade held a prominent place. The necessity of a banking \nsystem was felt in order to handle financial transactions between countries in import \nand export. So, banks were started in Sri Lanka.\n",

The necessity of a banking system was felt in order to handle financial transactions between countries in import and export. So, banks were started in Sri Lanka.- 18 -\nThe transport system had to be developed in order to carry the estate products to \ntrade centres and the harbour in Colombo and supply necessities to estates. Up to \nthis time transportation was done by means of carts. Because it was not so efficient, \nroads and railways were introduced. The Colombo - Kandy road was constructed \nduring the time of the governor, Edward Barns. Thereafter, roads to Kandy were built \nfrom Kurunegala and Dambulla. After that, the system of constructing roads using \nstones and tar was started. Further, the wood bridges that existed over water ways \nwere replaced by iron bridges. The governor, Henry Ward started laying railways. \nThe construction of the Kandy railway was started in 1858 and was completed in \n1863. In August 1867, a train service was started from Colombo to Kandy for the \nfirst time. After that it was extended from Peradeniya to  Nawalapitiya in 1871 and \nup to Bandarawela in 1899.\nWith the development of roads and transportation, trade centres were started and \nthey expanded to cities. Gampola, Badulla, Ratnapura and Matale are such cities \nbeyond Colombo that were populated during this time. Sending messages was done \nthrough a messenger up to this time. An official postal system had been started \nby 1815 connecting the cities like Colombo, Trincomalee, Galle, Kandy and Jaffna. \nThis was carried out using chariots.

After those two \nnations, the next European nation that imposed its power on Sri Lanka was the \nBritish.  They who spoke English language were called the English. This lesson \nexplains how the English established their power in Sri Lanka and the struggles \nthat arose against them in the first half of the 19th century.\n2.1 Arrival of British in Asia\nThe English who noticed that the Portuguese and the Dutch people were earning a \nlot of profit from the trade activities in Asia, also paid their attention to Asia. As a \nresult, a group of English businessmen established the East India Trade Company \nin December 1600, by a royal warrant obtained from Queen Elizabeth I to do trade \nactivities in Asia. The first fleet of ships of this company had gone to Sumatra islands \nand started trade. Then, another fleet of ships came to India under William Hokins \nand conducted discussions about trade with the Mughal emperor, Jahangir. \nAt the beginning of their visits to Asia, the English tried to tighten their trade \nrelations with Southeast Asian region.\nThere had been fights between the Portuguese and the Dutch to claim the trade \npower in Southeast Asia during the first two decades of the 17th century.  At \ncertain occasions, the English have given their assistance to the Dutch against the \nPortuguese. The Dutch never expected to see the English developing a power in \nSoutheast Asian islands where spices grew well, although they obtained the help \nof the English to fight their common enemy, the Portuguese.  Because of this, in \n1623, the Dutch attacked a fortress in a spices island, Ambon and killed a group \nof English people living there. As the English did not have sufficient power in the \nregion to retaliate the Dutch attack, they withdrew themselves from the southeast \nasian region.

As the English did not have sufficient power in the region to retaliate the Dutch attack, they withdrew themselves from the southeast asian region. It seems that they completely focused their attention on India after that.- 20 -\nIt took more than 10 years for the English to establish trade relations with India \nthough they tried it since 1607. As the English worked very tactfully in India, they \nwere able to start trade centres in several areas such as Bombay, Calcutta and Madras \nby the latter part of the 17th century. Yet, the English had to compete  with the \nFrench other than the Dutch to protect their trade because from 1664, the French \nalso came to India and established trade centres in places like Pondicherry, Karikal \nand Chadranagar.  A political battle began between the British and the French by \nthe 18th century to establish their power in India.\n2.2 The British focusing their Attention on Sri Lanka\nThe English did not pay any attention to Sri Lanka for about a century after they \ncame to India. The reasons for this are that the English had not yet firmly established \ntheir power in India and the Dutch had a strong fort system in the coastal line of \nthe island followed by the Portuguese. The English began to pay more attention to \nSri Lanka when they who were satisfied so far with trade power, started exercising \npolitical power on India in the first half of the 18th century because the Mughal \nempire in India started to decline. There were two major reasons for that special \nattention.\n1. The location of Sri Lanka\n2. Getting valuable trade items such as cinnamon from Sri Lanka \nThe English felt the importance of Sri Lanka owing to two reasons. They were; the \nlocation of Sri Lanka close to India and Sri Lanka being an excellent centre for \nthe administration of naval and trade activities in the maritime zone around India \nincluding the Bay of Bengal. The English strongly felt the necessity of a harbour to \nrepair the ships damaged due to enemy attacks in the fights between the British \nand the French around the Bay of Bengal.

Hence, the \nimportance of the geographical location of Sri Lanka and the great importance of \nthe Trincomalee harbour became the major reasons to draw the attention of the \nEnglish to Sri Lanka.\nSri Lanka was a famous country for spices like cinnamon even by that time.

Therefore, the English wanted to take the sole authority of selling \ncinnamon into their hands.

Other than cinnamon; pepper, cardamom, cloves, pearls, gems and ivory were some other items that had a good market. The English wanted to establish the political power in this country because of the above mentioned reasons. \uf0ea ACTIVITY 1 Discuss the factors that drew the attention of the English to Sri Lanka under the following headings. - Location of Sri Lanka - Ability to obtain spices such as cinnamon- 22 -\n\uf076\ufffdDiplomatic Relationships between the English and the Kandyan Kingdom\nIn the same way that they sought the assistance of the Dutch to chase the Portuguese \naway from Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan kings thought of seeking the assistance of some \nother nation to drive away the Dutch too. Therefore, King Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe \nsent messengers to both the English who were in India and the French. That paved \nthe way for the English messengers to reach the kingdom of Kandy. Three English \nmessengers had visited the Kandyan kingdom several times before they captured \nthe hill country. \n\uf034 In 1762, John Pybus came to the hill country\n\uf034 In 1782, Hugh Boyd came to the hill country\n\uf034 In 1795, Robert Andrews came to the hill country\nKing Keerthi Sri Rajasinghe was the ruler of the upcountry when John Pybus came \nthere. The other two messengers came during the reign of King Rajadhirajasinghe. \nThe English intended to establish trade relationships with Sri Lanka through the visits \nof John Pybus and Hugh Boyd. The English and the Dutch stopped their fighting \nduring these visits and used the Trincomalee harbour in mutual understanding \nwhen it was needed.  As a result the English were reluctant to help the king against \nthe Dutch. The kings of the hill country were not interested in creating bonds with \na nation that was not ready to help them defeat the Dutch. Therefore, the first two \ndiplomatic visits were not successful. \nAfter the English navy captured the Trincomalee harbour which was in the hands \nof the Dutch, in 1795, Robert Andrews visited the hill country and met King \nRajadhirajasinghe. The purpose of his visit was to discuss with the king how they \ncould get the assistance of the kingdom of Kandy in the fights to conquer the areas \ngoverned by the Dutch. The king agreed to support the English forces. Yet, the \nEnglish, after capturing the Dutch fortresses, understood that the battle against the \nDutch was not as hard as they anticipated. Therefore, the English did not like to \nshare with the Sinhala kings, the profits they would receive by capturing the Dutch \nheld areas. As a result, the English did not wish to agree to the conditions of the king \nand establish long lasting relationships with the king of the hill country.\n",

Yet, the English Trade Company did not understand this. Therefore the English hired- 25 -\nofficers from the Madras government and governed the parts they captured under \nMadras rulers. This lasted from 1796 to 1798. \nA Resident was appointed to Sri Lanka under the Madras administration to rule the \ncoastal areas of Sri Lanka. A group of assistant supervisors was appointed under the \nResident to collect income and they were named as collectors. Their service centre \nwas named as Kachcheri. That was how the Kachcheri system was started in Sri \nLanka. Another group of officers was appointed in assistance to the collectors who \nwere called as Avumildars. More officers were there to help the Avumildars and all \nthese groups were engaged in collecting income under the supervision of collectors.\n \nThe local officers like Mudliers were ignored in the English administration. People \nwere brought from Madras for the above posts and those who came from Madras \ndid not have any knowledge about the local languages, culture and traditions. The \nrelationship between the general public and the administrative officers became \ndistanced because such a group of officers was appointed for the civil administration, \nlegal system and income collection. \nThe India Trade Company had spent a lot of money in capturing the coastal belt of \nSri Lanka. Another significant feature of the British administration is their attempts \nto cover the above mentioned cost and to achieve fast profits.  They imposed several \nnew taxes in the coastal areas to meet the above target. People in the coastal areas \nwere in trouble when they had to pay those taxes in cash. One such example is the \nnewly introduced \u2018tax on coconut trees.\u2019 Thus, someone who owned more than 10 \ncoconut trees had to pay a tax of one silver panam (six cents) for each coconut tree. \nPeople were irritated because the tax was charged without considering the nature of \nthe harvest and they had to pay it in cash.  This soon became an insurgency due to \nthe repugnance of the general public towards the new administration. This rebellion \nthat began in 1797 against the India Trade Company extended to all coastal areas \nquickly. This was suppressed after much effort by the British.

One was Kannasami and the other was \nMuththusami. According to a plan of Pilimathalawe who was the \u2018Maha Adikaram\u2019 \nof the hill country kingdom, prince Kannasami was coronated as \u2018Sri Wickrama \nRajasinghe.\u2019 Then, prince Muththusami escaped to the English for protection.\nFig 2.4 \u2013 King Sri Wickrama \nRajasinghe         \nThe British, soon after establishing their power \nin the coastal regions of the country, eyed on \nthe hill country kingdom also. The policy of the \ngovernor, Fredric North is very significant here. \nHe tried to get the consent of the hill country \nking to a treaty which was more advantageous \nto the British. He sent envoys to the hill country \nheaded by Commander MacDowell in 1800. He \nstrengthened the convoy with 1164 soldiers and 8 \ncannons in order to display their military power \nand get the king\u2019s consent to a treaty which was \nmore beneficial for them. Yet, King Sri Wickrama \nRajasinghe denied the permission of allowing \nsuch a massive army and cannons entering the \nupcountry.  As a result the envoys had to enter the \nkingdom alone leaving the soldiers and cannons \noutside the upcountry. Though MacDowell had discussions with the king and the \nother aristocrats, the king did not agree to the conditions of the British. So, this \nmission became a complete failure. \nNorth was distressed because he could not get the sanction of the king. He considered \nthe independent government of the upcountry as a threat to their power in the \ncoastal regions. Because the British had to employ a massive army for the security \nof the coastal areas and the protection of the inland territories, they were forced \nto bear a huge cost. Another problem they faced was that the general public of the \ncoastal areas still accepted the upcountry king as their king too and when there \nwere insurgencies the upcountry king helped the rebels. The British further knew \nthat if the upcountry king happened to request the support of the French who were \nthe enemies of the British, that would be an added threat to their administration. \nOn the other hand, the English wanted to have contact with Trincomalee which \nwas their main naval centre from the administration centre of Colombo via land. \nThey had to cross the territories of the upcountry in order to keep contact between \nColombo and Trincomalee. The English wanted to build a road between these \ntwo cities. Owing to the above reasons, the British paid their attention to either \nconquering the upcountry or winning their good will.\n",

So, North sent two troops of soldiers to the \nhill country from Trincomalee and Colombo in January and February, 1803. In \nthis invasion, which was headed by MacDowell, the British troops entered the hill \ncountry on 21st of February. King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe and the citizens vacated \nthe city as a security measure and started organizing themselves. The British \nnamed prince Muttusami who had been brought to the upcountry with them as the \nking. But, the people of upcountry started to get together with king Sri Wickrama \nRajasinghe and prepared for the war ignoring Muttusami. \n \nThe British had to face unexpected difficulties with the beginning of the rainy season \nbecause epidemics started spreading among the British troops. At the same time, as \na result of the upcountry people blocking all supply means, the English suffered due \nto lack of food and difficulty of communication with Colombo. The English troops \nsuffered heavy losses under the timely attacks of the upcountry people. Happening \nto let their puppet ruler, prince Muttusami to be captured by the upcountry people, \nprovides evidence to the seriousness of the defeat the British experienced.  \n Before this attack, the governor North did not have a clear understanding about \nthe hill country. Yet, when his invasion ended in defeat, he understood that the \nupcountry kingdom is strong and it cannot be overpowered by such attacks. Hence, \nthe British moved into a highly tactful policy regarding the hill country after the \ninvasion of 1803. \n\uf076\ufffdInvasion of the Hill Country in 1815\n Thomas Maitland was appointed the governor of Sri Lanka at the end of the \ngovernor North\u2019s session of duty in 1805.

As \na result he was capable of winning the hearts of not only the general public but also \nthe aristocrats of the hill country.

They- 30 -\nwere the group that acted as the leaders in organizing the general public to protect \nthe king and the kingdom during the early invasions of the Europeans. \n The relationship between the king and the monks had also been broken because \nseveral monks had been killed during that time. The bond between the king and the \npeople had also been broken due to some decisions the king made during the last \nfew years of his reign. The king prohibited staying in the city at night for the people \nwho had come from regions like Sabaragamuwa, Sath Korala and Sathara Korala \nfor the services like extending the Bogambara tank, building the \u2018Paththirippu\u2019 \n(the octagon) and renovations of the Kandy city. Therefore, they faced a number of \ndifficulties.  \n Though the rebellion against the king that arose in Sabaragamuwa could have been, \neasily suppressed more than 100 individuals were killed in it. History says that the \nking ordered to brutally massacre the wife and the children of Ehalepola because he \ncould not be arrested after the rebellion. These inhuman acts of the king had created \na wide gap between the king and the people of the country by 1815. \n Whenever the Europeans invaded the upcountry, the aristocrats and the general \npublic sacrificed their lives to protect the king.  The same human shield that guarded \nthe upcountry kingdom turned against the king because of his own deeds. As a \nresult the king was at danger in his own kingdom and this became an advantage to \nthe British. The governor, Brownrigg took advantage of this situation and when he \ninvaded the upcountry in January 1815, people did not come forward to protect the \nking. The governor had spread messages among the upcountry people saying that \ntheir real enemy was not the British people but the king himself and the invasion is \nreally for the sake of the upcountry people. \n King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe gave up the Kandy city and escaped to a secure \nplace as the British invaded the upcountry.

Therefore, they rose against the English in 1818 and 1848 using their traditional ways of attack. The natives called them as attempts to win the lost independence back by chasing the foreigners away from the hill country whereas the British interpreted them as rebellions against the government.- 33 -\nTherefore they became the first freedom struggles that arose against the British \nadministration. Let\u2019s now discuss the struggle of 1818.\n\uf076\ufffdThe Struggle for Freedom in 1818\nThe armed insurgencies against the English government that existed from September, \n1817 to October 1818 in the hill country were called as the Struggle for Freedom in \n1818. The aristocrats and the general public moved to such a struggle even before \nthree years after the English administration started because of the dissatisfaction \nthey had about the ruling system. This proves that there had been several reasons \nthat encouraged the hill country people for the 1818 struggle.\n\uf076\ufffdReasons for the 1818 Struggle\n\uf034The regret of the loss of a king and the freedom.\nIt is clear that the people of the upcountry had grievances over the loss of freedom \nthey enjoyed under a ruling system of their own even during the times when the low \ncountry was governed by the Portuguese and the Dutch. \nEven though it was announced after the colonization that the king of Britain was \nthe king of the upcountry also; the people of the hill country had never seen the so \ncalled king. They wanted a king who lived in their capital city, who could listen to \ntheir grievances and give solutions to them instead of a never seen king who lived \nin a country thousands of miles away. Because they could not see a king they tend \nto believe that the country was throneless. The following two poems believed to be \ncomposed by a monk who lived those days displaying the distress they had because \nthey did not have a king.\nOh! Dear ants\n you have a king\n what can we do\n this is our destiny\n when will we have a king \n to celebrate with milk rice\n respect with pageants \n chant with \u201csadu sadu\u201d\nFig 2.8 \u2013 The throne of King \nSri Wikrama Rajasinghe\n",

This is evident in the statements such as, conducting pageants \nand chanting \u2018sadu, sadu\u2019. Another example for this is the support of monks for the \nstruggle.\nThe people of the hill country suspected that their traditions and culture would \nbe destroyed in the hands of foreigners. Under a traditional ruling system a king\u2019s \nmajor duty was to protect the customs. There were a number of traditions regarding \nthe palace, courts and administration matters. Uniforms were designed for each \npost under the old administration in a way that they were honoured and respected. \nBut, the English soldiers who came to the Kandy city did not follow those traditions. \nAs a result, a gap was created between the British and the people of the hill country \nreligiously as well as culturally. This generated a desire for freedom in the hearts of \nthe upcountry people.\n\uf034\ufffdAttacks on the Upcountry Aristocrats\nAlthough the British continued with the traditional upcountry posts according to \nthe 1815 treaty, the social status and the power of the aristocrats were not stable. \nThey had complained to D'oyly that the British soldiers did not respect them. The \ntraditional earnings of the aristocrats too were challenged. One example for this \nis the loss of income the aristocrats suffered because the English cancelled the \ntax called \u201ckadwath badda\u201d. The British could change the traditional posts of the \naristocrats as well. There was a tradition to always appoint a Sinhalese to the post \nof \u2018Madihe Mohandiram\u2019 who was in charge of upcountry transport. But the British \nbreaking this tradition, appointed a Muslim called \u2018Hajji Marikkar\u2019 to this post. \nThis created a distress among the aristocrats of Uva Wellassa. They tend to lead the \nstruggle because their privilege, status and earnings were attacked in many ways.\n\uf034\ufffdNature of the Struggle\nWhile there was a growing displeasure about the British administration among the \nupcountry people, a person called Doresami  emerged from Wellassa  who claimed \nto be an heir to the throne. The Badulla agent Douglas Wilson, came to know that \nhe was gathering forces to regain the kingdom with the help of the local elite like \n\u2018Kohu  Kumbure  Rate  Rala\u2019.  Hence,  Douglas  Wilson  sent  a platoon  with  Hajji \nMuhandiram  to  arrest Doresami. Yet, he was killed by the rebels. Then Douglas \n",

Hence, Douglas Wilson sent a platoon with Hajji Muhandiram to arrest Doresami. Yet, he was killed by the rebels. Then Douglas- 35 -\nWilson too was killed by an archer when he set out to arrest Doresami. When the \ngovernment noticed that the people of Wellassa were gathering around Doresami, \nthey sent Kappetipola who was in charge of Uva to control the situation. Nevertheless, \nKeppetipola returned the English troops that came with him and joined the rebels. \nThis resulted in the fights spreading to many parts of the upcountry. Among the \naristocrats, only Molligoda and Eknaligoda Disawe did not join the fights.\nDoresami was declared the upcountry king by the rebels under the guidance of \nKappetipola. Kappetipola Disawe was appointed the Mahaadikaram of the new king. \nAnother problem the British faced was the Tooth Relic which was believed to be the \nsymbol of the kingship falling into the hands of rebels. Ehelepola too was suspected \nby the British because of the close kinship he had with the other aristocrats who \nwere leading the struggle though he did not join the fights. Because of that he was \narrested and brought to Colombo by the British.\nThe \nBritish \nwere \ntoo \nvicious \nin \nsuppressing the battle. The governor \nimposed martial law to the upcountry \nin February, 1818. The British troops \nthat were there in the coastal regions \nwere summoned to the upcountry. They \nfollowed a land sweeping policy to wipe \nout the rebels. Setting fire to villages, \narresting as many men as possible and \nprosecuting under martial law were \nsome strategies they used. The upcountry \npeople could not persist with the battle \nin the face of the harsh retaliation of \nthe British. So, the British were able to \narrest several leaders of the battle. Some \nof those arrested were Maththamagoda, \nKobbekaduwa, \nDambawinna \nDisawe \nand Galagedara Mohottala, Basnayaka \nNilame of Katharagama, Butawe Rate \nRala and Ehelepola Adikaram.  \nThe English spread news saying that the \none who said to be the king in the battle \nFig 2.9 \u2013 Kappetipola Disawe\nwas not the real Doresami and he was not the real heir to the throne.

The English spread news saying that the one who said to be the king in the battle Fig 2.9 \u2013 Kappetipola Disawe was not the real Doresami and he was not the real heir to the throne. There were disputes among the main leaders of the struggle such as Kappetipola, Madugalle- 36 -\nand Pilimathalawe. By August and September of 1818, the battle had died down a \nlot. The English were able to arrest Kappetipola and Madugalle in October. They \nwere sentenced to death by the court martial. They were executed by the British on \nthe 26th of November, 1818. \n\uf076\ufffdFailure of the 1818 Battle and Its Effects\nThe rebellion spread fast within a few months after the beginning. When the British \nforces chased away the rebels from one area by destroying property, the battle \nstarted in another place. Yet, the upcountry people failed to launch a combined \nattack when the English started a heavy retaliation with extra forces. They had an \nadvantage when it became possible for them to keep contact with Colombo via \nSathara Korala because the in-charge of that area, Molligoda Nilame was partial to \nthe British. Thus, there were several reasons for the loss of the battle. Some of them \ncan be summarized as follows.\n\uf076\ufffdReasons for the failure of the 1818 Battle:\n\uf034\ufffd The heavy retaliation launched by the British\n\uf034\ufffd Shortage experienced by the upcountry people, of weapons and other resources \nthat are needed for a long battle\n\uf034\ufffd Disorganized nature of the battle\n\uf034\ufffd The exposure of the real identity of the person who claimed to be the heir to \nthe throne.\nAs a result of the battle for freedom, leaders like Ehelepola, Kappitipola, Madugalle \nhad to sacrifice their lives for the independence of the country. Property of some \nmore aristocrats were confiscated. Some leaders who supported the battle were \nbanished from the country. Those who went against the government were punished \nthus whereas the other aristocrats like Molligoda, Eknaligoda who were partial to \nthe English were rewarded.\nThe British were able to strengthen their grip of the upcountry region because \nthe 1818 battle was lost. The governor, Brownrigg issued a special announcement \nstrengthening his power in the upcountry on the 21st of November, 1818. This long \ndocument which consisted of 56 statements curtailed the power of the aristocrats. \nSteps were taken to establish the English legal system in the upcountry reducing the \nlegal power enjoyed by the aristocrats. It seems that the 1818 November document \nmade the British power in the upcountry complete.\n",

It seems that the 1818 November document made the British power in the upcountry complete.- 37 -\n\uf076\ufffdStruggle for Independence in 1848\nIn about 30 years following the failure of the 1818 struggle, there was another battle \nagainst the British government. This struggle which tried for the second time to \nreestablish the imperial system the upcountry people used to have, can be named as \nthe second armed battle for the independence. There were several reasons that led \nto the emergence of such a battle which began in 1848.\n\uf076\ufffdCauses of the Battle\nThere were two major factors that led to the 1848 struggle as the effects of the \nColebrooke reforms and the new tax policy of the government.\n\uf076\ufffdEffects of the Colebrooke Reforms\n\uf034Land Policy of the Government\nThe government launched a policy of selling lands under the Colebrooke reforms \nwhich were started in 1833. The government land policy was problematic for the \ngeneral public of the area because the land in the upcountry was rich and the \nenvironment was conducive for coffee cultivation. According to the Barron Land \nAct imposed in 1840, uncultivated lands that could not be proven of their continual \nownership for 30 years were confiscated.  There were no legal documents to prove the \nownership of lands of the upcountry people that came to them from their descent. \nAs a result, many of their Chena lands were taken back to the government. The \ngovernment sold these lands for very cheaper prices to the foreigners. Because the \npeople lost their lands and the cultivation was disturbed thus, they were distressed \nabout the government.\n\uf034Discontinuation of \u201cGam Sabha\u201d\nThe existence of \u2018Gam Sabha\u2019 was challenged because the compulsory service \nsystem and the duty labour system were banned by the Colebrooke Commission. \nThe building and maintenance  of lakes, bunds, canals and dams of each area were \ndone by the Gam Sabha (village council). The  major method the Gam Sabha got \nlabour was the system called \"duty labour\". Yet, when this method was cancelled, \nthe Gam Sabha found it difficult to get necessary labour forces. The Gam Sabha\ndid a good service by solving the minor problems in the area. But, they lost their \njudiciary power due to the reforms in 1833. The villagers had to suffer due to such \nreasons.\n",

The Gam Sabha did a good service by solving the minor problems in the area. But, they lost their judiciary power due to the reforms in 1833. The villagers had to suffer due to such reasons.- 38 -\n\uf034New Judiciary System\nVillagers had to go to courts even for a small matter according to Cameron\u2019s legal \nreforms. Earlier, they could get such matters resolved in their villages. They were \nnot aware either of the English language or the rules and regulations that were in \nfunction in the new courts. Some other problems the villagers had to face were that \nthey had to pay all lawyers\u2019 charges, stamp fees in cash and had to spend days in the \ncourt when they went for legal matters. As a result, their agricultural work including \nthe protection of their cultivations was neglected.\n\uf034Distancing Relationship between the People and the Government\nThe decisions to reduce the number of civil service posts and allowing the civil \nservants to engage themselves in estate cultivation following the Colebrooke \nrecommendations, made the local administration inefficient. As a result, the area \nof the administration officer expanded and they found it difficult to supervise such \na big area. Because some officers were more attentive on cultivation, they did not \nhave enough time to attend to the needs of the people. As a result, the problems of \nthe general public were not properly informed to the government and it affected to \nwiden the relationship between the people and the government.\n\uf034The New Tax Policy of the Government\nThe closest reason for the struggle was the decision of the governor, Sir Torrington \nto impose new taxes in 1848. Because the government income had gone down, the \ngovernor made a tax reform with the purpose of earning a considerable sum from \nthe people. A stamp fee, cart and catamaran tax, tax on shops, tax on guns, body tax, \nand tax on dogs were those new taxes. People opposed all those taxes; especially the \nprotest against the taxes on guns, body and dogs was significant. \nThe villagers used guns to protect their cultivations. They had to pay two shillings \nand a half every year for the tax on guns. The villagers had to go to government \noffices for this and to fill in the forms in English language. They had to pay \nextra charges in addition to the time spent. Charges they had to pay for the guns \nsometimes exceeded the real value of the guns. There was a resistance for the tax on \nguns because of the above reasons. \nEvery grown up male had to work in building roads for six days every year and \nif they failed to do so they had to pay three shillings as a tax on their body. There \nwas opposition for this tax also. People had to pay taxes for dogs in 1848. This was \n",

The \ngovernment conducted a survey for the collection of statistics called the \u2018Blue Book\u2019 \nat the same time when new taxes were imposed. The people suspected this move too \nas a way of imposing more taxes. \n\uf076\ufffdNature of the 1848 Struggle\nFights began between the government and the people when people gathered to \noppose the tax policy of the government. People gathered in major cities such as \nColombo, Galle, Kandy and Badulla and they protested against the English civil \nservants in these rallies. Some farmers that gathered in Badulla smashed their guns \non the ground in front of the government agents to show their displeasure. Around \n4000 people gathered in front of the Kandy Kachcheri and protested against these \ntaxes. Armed forces had to be summoned because the police could not control those \ncrowds. The protests that began in Colombo and Kandy spread to areas like Matale, \n  Dambulla, Wariyapola and Kurunegala.\nPeople in areas like Matale, Wariyapola and Kurunegala organized themselves with \narms and attacked the government buildings like courts. As the people were under \nhigh pressure due to the tax policy of the government, leaders like Gongalegoda \nBanda, Puran Appu, Dingirala and Diyes emerged from people and led the battle. \nA group of rebels gathered in the Dambulla temple and coronated Gongalegoda \nBanda as the king with the help of the chief incumbent. \nMatale was the centre of the battle in 1848. In addition to this, fights spread to some \nparts of the Kandy and Kurunegala districts. But, the English using their experience \nof the 1818 battle overpowered the insurgency soon. The struggle soon broke down \ndue to the suppression launched by the governor, Torrington employing the armed \nforces. As a result, the British were able to arrest many of the leaders within two \nmonths of the battle. Gongalegoda Banda, who was arrested so, was trialed, whipped \nand exiled from the country. Puran Appu was sentenced to death and he faced  death \nbravely. Some other fighters were imprisoned. At the same time, there was a strong \nindignation against the government because the arrested Rev. Kadahapola Thero \nwas shot and killed after a very short trial without taking proper legal actions.  \n\uf076\ufffdFailure of the Battle\nThe major reason for the failure of the struggle was its disorganized nature similar to \nthe 1818 battle.

As a result Buddhists, Hindus \nand Muslims of the country were religiously and nationally aroused towards the \nend of the 19th century. That situation is explained as national renaissance in this \nlesson. \n3.1  Background of the National Renaissance\nThe Europeans tried to spread their religion and culture in the areas they conquered \nin Asia in order that they have a loyal group of people in those countries. When \nthe Portuguese and the Dutch governed the coastal regions of the country, they \nhad to restrict their religious and cultural activities to the areas they governed, \nbecause there was an independent kingdom in the upcountry. Doors opened for \nthe western culture to spread under the British reign throughout the country, with \nthe submission of the upcountry. \n\uf076 Activities of Missionary Organizations\nSeveral foreign organizations that came to Sri Lanka during the British reign started \nspreading Catholicism in the country.

At the same time they dedicated to starting and \nconducting schools. In schools maintained by the missionaries a prominent place \nwas given to spread the religion. The government assistance was given to missionary \neducation. English knowledge was necessary to get a government post during \nthe English reign. Therefore, the Sinhalese and Tamil children had to attend the \nmissionary schools to get English knowledge. \n3.2 Buddhist Renaissance\nThere was a necessity of replying to what the missionaries said about traditional \nreligions. They criticized some Buddhist and Hindu traditions in their preaching \nand publications saying that worshipping statues was futile. Another need arose \nof lifting up the education of native languages because there was no government \nassistance for the education of native languages such as Sinhalese and Tamil. \nThe Buddhist monks became the pioneers to find solutions to these problems. \nA landmark in Buddhist education field was the establishment of the Parama \nDhamma Chethiya Pirivena in Rathmalana by Rev. Walane Siddhartha thero. This \npirivena produced a group of both lay and ordained pundits who studied languages \nlike Sinhalese, Pali and Sanscrit and those who valued the indigenous culture. Rev. \nHikkaduwe Sri Sumangala thero who was among them started the Vidyodaya \nPirivena at Maligakanda in 1873. Rev. Ratmalane Dhammaloka thero established \nthe Vidyalankara Pirivena at Peliyagoda in 1875. As a result of the re-establishment \nof pirivena system, more educated people were created and it became a blessing for \nthe Buddhist renaissance. \n\uf076 Establishment of Publishers\nRev. Bulathgama Dhammalankara Siri Sumanathissa thero took steps to open a \npress which many Buddhists longed to have for a long time. The thero worked to get \nfinancial assistance from the King of Thailand (Siam) because the funds collected \nfrom Sri Lankan philanthropists were not enough for the purpose.

The \nBritish introduced several constitutional reforms to the country from time to time. \nSri Lankans, who were not contented with those reforms, engaged themselves in \ncontinuous protests demanding more power to be enjoyed in administration. As \na result of these protests, they were able to win the administrative power back \nin 1948 for themselves. The details of the constitutional reforms introduced to \nthe island by the British and the protests of the Sri Lankans are discussed in this \nlesson.\n4 .1  Colebrooke Reforms of 1833 \nWhen the British governors ruled the country after 1815, the expenditure exceeded \nthe income of the government. As a result, the governors of Sri Lanka had to request \nfor money from the British government to cover the expenditure of the country. \nSpending money for the functioning of colonies was not the policy of Britain. \nTherefore, the secretary to the colonies appointed W.H.G. Colebrooke (William \nMac Bean George Colebrooke) to probe into the situation of Sri Lanka and make \nrecommendations. In1829, he came to Sri Lanka and his duty was to investigate \ninto the political and economic situation of the country. Charles Hae Cameron was \nappointed by the secretary to the colonies to probe into the existing situation in the \nlegal system and courts and give recommendations. He came to Sri Lanka in 1830 \nfollowing this appointment. A constitutional reform was introduced to the country \nbased on the suggestions of the Colebrooke Commission in 1833.

This nationalist representative system \nproduced harmful results to the country in the future.\nThe unofficial members who represented the general public could not exercise \ntheir power because the majority of the council was official members. The governor \ncould appoint members who were loyal to him because it was he who exercised the \npower of appointing the unofficial members. As a result, the legislative council was \nloyal to the governor.\nColebrooke had recommended appointing a group including the secretary of the \ncolony, treasurer, accountant, head surveyor, cashier of the Colombo customs \ndepartment to the executive council which was appointed in 1833. The purpose of \nappointing this council was to limit the excessive power exercised by the governor in \nfinancial matters. Hence the governor was ordered to discuss all matters regarding \nincome and expenditure with the executive council. Though the governor was not \nbound to follow the advice of the executive council, he was required to seek the \napproval of the secretary to the colonies in such a situation.\n\uf076 Struggles of Europeans\nIt was a group of European businessmen that first launched a struggle to get certain \nareas of the Colebrooke reforms amended. There were three unofficial members in \nthe legislative council to represent the Europeans who were living in the country. \nThose Europeans who were engaged in estate cultivation in the country wanted to \nget roads, railways and other infrastructure that was necessary for estate cultivation \ndeveloped. Yet, it was difficult to get financial allocations for the above mentioned \nsections because at the beginning, administrative power was not vested upon \nthe legislative council. At the same time, they were not happy of the fact that the \nnumber of unofficial members in the legislative council was the minority. They \nfurther opposed to the fact that they were appointed by the governor without using \nfranchise for that. They started a limited struggle demanding the above changes. \nTheir methods of struggle were; asking questions in the legislative council, making \nproposals, publishing articles in newspapers, establishing organizations for struggle \netc. One such organization was Lanka Congress established in 1865 and headed \nby George Wall. The number of unofficial members in the legislative council was \nincreased to 08 because of these protests. The two new members were selected for \nthe upcountry Sinhalese and Muslims. Though the objective of Europeans\u2019 struggle \nwas not to give administration power to Sri Lankans, those Sri Lankans took these \nstruggles as examples.\n",

As a result of this, the old elite class faded \nout paving the way to a new Sri Lankan middle class to appear by the beginning of \nthe 20th century. In parallel to the changes that took place in the economy and the \nsociety during the 70 years after 1833, no change occurred in the political system. \nAs the Sri Lankan middle class was unhappy about this, they began to demand for a \nconstitutional reform during the period between 1908 - 1909.\nMr.James Pieris presented a formal petition for the first time to the secretary of the \ncolonies requesting a constitutional reform in December 1908. After that, several \nother organizations had followed Mr. James Pieris. Low Country Production Club, \nChilaw Club, Jaffna Club are some of them.\nSeveral of the major demands made by the Sri Lankans are given below.\n\u2022 Increasing the number of unofficial members in the legislative council\n\u2022 Discontinuation of the nationalist representative system\n\u2022 Electing members from provinces according to the provincial representative \nsystem\n\u2022 Increasing the power of the legislative committee\nThe governor of Sri Lanka that time, Henry McCallum \nopposed to these proposals. He argued that those who \nhad presented petitions did not represent the general \npublic. But, the colonial office could not ignore the \nlogical arguments put forward for constitutional \nreforms. Even the colonial officers agreed to the fact \nthat a constitutional reform is necessary because 75 \nyears had passed after the Colebrooke reforms were \nimplemented. Thus, in November 1910, the secretary \nof the colonies exclaimed that a constitutional  reform \nwould be made.  The new constitution designed by the \nsecretary of the colonies, Lord Crew according to the \nrecommendations of then governor; Henry McCallum \nis called the \u201cCrew \u2013 McCallum Constitution\u201d.\n Fig. 4.1 Mr. James Pieris \n",

The middle class was not happy about those reforms. A temperance movement was started in protest to- 57 -\nthe decision of the government to impose a new excise ordinance in 1912 giving \npermission to open new toddy bars. \nHow a temperance movement emerged through the religious renaissance in protest \nto the increasing alcohol consumption during the British reign was explained in \nUnit Three. The purpose of this temperance movement was to make people aware \nof the harmful effects of alcohol consumption and help them give up the bad habit. \nBut, protests were staged against the new excise policy of the government in 1912. \nThe pioneers of this protest were the middle class people who could not win their \ndemands from 1910 reforms. As a result, these protests in 1912 had a political \ninclination. Some distinguished features of these protests were;\n\u2022 attempting to create a public opinion against the excise policy of the government\n\u2022 unison of the middle class English educated and the activists of the religious \nrenaissance\n\u2022 building up of a network of non-alcoholic associations around the country based \non the central non-alcoholic council in Colombo\n\u2022 criticizing the government activities in the non-alcoholic protests\nBecause of the protests in 1912, some taverns were closed and it became difficult to \nfind places to open new ones. The government was seeking an opportunity to abate \nthe temperance movement because the activities of the movement were successful \nwith people gathering around the associations and the government activities were \ncondemned in their protests. When the situation was thus, there arose riots between \nthe Sinhalese and the Muslims in Kandy in 1915. It is known as the Sinhalese- Muslim \nriots. The government ignored the riots till the situation became extremely tensed \nand then took undue advantage of it and tried to suppress the temperance movement. \nThere, the government arrested a majority of the non-alcoholic leaders and banned \nsome Sinhala newspapers. On the face of this suppression, the activities of the \ntemperance movement were badly affected. Nevertheless, some leaders who entered \npolitics through non-alcoholic activities; like F. R. Senanayake, D. S. Senanayake \nand Sir D. B. Jayathilaka later became national leaders. \n\uf076 Influence of the Indian Nationalist Movement\nThe British power had spread into both Sri Lanka and India by the 19th century. \nThere emerged a powerful nationalist movement in India which was a British \ncolony by the beginning of the 20th century.

Yet, there was no any common \norganization to organize political protests even by \n1919. Though there were several small organizations \nthey did not have a strong voice.

Out of these 37, 8 were \nnominated by the governor and 29 were elected. The most important feature of this \nreform was that the number of elected members was the majority even though the \n12 unofficial members and the nominated 8 made 29 in unison. The functioning \nof  the government was still the responsibility of the governor. Nevertheless, the \npower of decision making was in the hands of the members elected by the people \nbecause the governor did not enjoy a majority which was loyal to him. Hence, there \nwere disturbances to the smooth functioning of the government because it became \na constitution that divided the power and the responsibility into two. Hue Clifford, \nthe governor who was appointed after William Manning informed this situation to \nthe colonial office and the Donoughmore Commission was appointed to examine \nthe situation and make recommendations. \n4.3  Donoughmore Constitution \u2013 1931\nThe Donoughmore Commission which was headed by Lord Donoughmore came to \nSri Lanka in 1927 and got the views of the Sri Lankans. The constitution proposed \nbased on this came into effect from 1931. It is known as the Donoughmore \nConstitution.

At the beginning, if one wanted to be a voter they should possess a \nconsiderable wealth. Therefore, the poor general public could not enjoy franchise. \nAs a result, the percentage of franchise holders was just 4% of the population as late \nas 1924. Females too did not enjoy this franchise. The Donoughmore Commission \nexplained the fact that the politicians did not pay enough attention to the problems \nof the people with low income because those who enjoyed franchise were only the \nwealthy class. At the same time, they pointed out the fact that the general public \npaid no attention to political issues because they did not enjoy franchise. Therefore, \nthe commission recommended that all males and females who were above 21 years \nwere granted franchise irrespective of their wealth and educational qualifications. \nAs a result of this, Sri Lankans got the universal franchise in 1931. That was a great \nvictory the general public got. \n\uf076  Executive Committee System \nThe relationship between the legislature and the executive was limited before the \nDonoughmore reforms.

The money collected by \nselling sunflowers was spent for the betterment of the poor of this country. The \nCommunists announced that buying poppy flowers is being loyal to imperialism \nbecause the money collected by selling poppy flowers was \nsent to Britain and wearing sunflowers is a way of taking \npart in the struggle for independence. The British policies \nwere criticized by the propagations that said poppy flowers \nwere a symbol of slavery and sunflowers were a symbol \nof independence.

Yet, there were drastic changes in \nall those areas by the time Sri Lanka won the independence in 1948. These changes \nshow the effect of the British rule in Sri Lanka. The previous lesson explained how \nthe traditional imperial system changed to a parliamentary system during the \nBritish reign. This lesson focuses on the changes that occurred in socio \u2013 economic \nand cultural aspects of the country during the British rule.    \n5.1.  Economic Changes\nThe foundation of Sri Lanka's traditional social, economic and cultural systems runs \nback to the Anuradapura era. That socio - economic system which was built on the \ndoctrine of Buddhism from the rule of king Devanampiyatissa began to experience \nchange after the arrival of Portuguese in the 16th century. The agricultural activities \nin Portuguese held areas suffered drawbacks because they paid more attention to \ntrade during their rule. When the Dutch was in power in the coastal areas, they \ngrew cinnamon and pepper, etc. targeting export. Furthermore, a group of labourers \nstarted to emerge because the Dutch started some minor industries and a payment \nsystem for the work covered daily. These Europeans failed to make a significant \nchange in the traditional socio \u2013 economic system because the major part of the \nisland was still under the power of the Kandyan kingdom during the time in which \nthe coastal areas were governed by the Dutch and the Portuguese. \nThere existed a social system which was based on the traditional socio-economic \nactivities when Sri Lanka was captured by the British. There was an elite group in \nthat society but they were a small minority. The country was mostly governed by \nthe aristocrats. The greater majority of the country were the general public and they \nlived on agriculture. \n",

There was an elite group in that society but they were a small minority. The country was mostly governed by the aristocrats. The greater majority of the country were the general public and they lived on agriculture.- 66 -\nThe traditional life style of this country was based on the village. It was named as \na local self\u2013sufficient economic system because the people of the village produced \ntheir food in the village itself. There was mutual support and harmony in the village. \nThere was no working for wages those days. Agriculture was continued, taking help \nfrom each other on daily basis which was called \u2018Aththama\u2019.  As a result, the use of \nmoney was minimum in that society.\nThe \u2018 Gamsabha \u2018(Village Council) settled the minor complaints  about minor issues \nbetween villagers. The Gamsabha played a major role in community work such as \nbuilding  canal bunds, maintenance of lakes,  building up of pagodas and roads \nbefore the Kandyan  kingdom. The Gamsabha could get the necessary labour for the \nabove mentioned duties under the traditional duty service system. By the time of \nthe Kandyan Kingdom \u2018Gamsabha\u2019 had become a minor court in the village.\nThe labour needed for the government was received through the duty service system \nby the administration under the ruling system before 1815.There were two ways of \nproviding service as compulsory service system and duty, based on land occupancy. \nIn the past, those who supplied compulsory service to the king were awarded land \nfor their existence. Those who cultivated these lands which were called as service \npatrimony lands provided necessary services to the king. Officials who received \nthese lands gave them to the general public for cultivation and they had to repay it \nby providing services through labour.

Often, the labour necessary for the common activities of the village was taken from this compulsory service system. \uf076 Economic Reforms in Colebrooke Commission The major reason for sending the Colebrooke Commission to Sri Lanka was the expenditure of the government exceeded the income of the government. Colebrooke tried to introduce several economic reforms to Sri Lanka because he wanted to establish an economic system that met the objectives of the English. The government- 67 -\nwanted to invest money on profitable business in order to avoid financial difficulties \nthe government faced. The objective of the Colebrooke Commission was to build \na situation in which the private entrepreneurs could invest money because the \ngovernment could not afford it.\nColebrooke recommended that the government should move into a policy of selling \nlands because the existing traditional land tenure system was an obstacle for the \nprivate entrepreneurship. Thus, both the locals and foreigners had the opportunity \nto buy land as much as they wanted. The civil servants too got the opportunity of \nbuying government lands because Colebrooke recommended that all civil servants \nare permitted to engage themselves in estate cultivation.\nThe investors who bought lands wanted labour to cultivate those lands. According \nto the traditional compulsory service system, people were forced to work for the \ngovernment with no wages. Colebrooke noticed that they were not suitable for \nthe private entrepreneurship and it was an obstacle for the freedom of the people. \nTherefore, he thought of abolishing the compulsory service. As a result, labour \nbecame something that could be bought and that was the beginning of a labour \nclass that worked for wages in Sri Lanka.\nWhen Colebrooke came to Sri Lanka, cinnamon and salt trade was a government \nmonopoly. Continuing a government monopoly does not match with the private \nentrepreneurship. Therefore it was suggested to break the monopoly on cinnamon \nand salt trade and allow the private sector too join that trade. The taxes that were \nthe government income those days were the levies on fish, land and alcohol and \nthey were charged directly. For an example, a portion of the fish caught had to be \nsubmitted as tax. The right to earn taxes was auctioned and the fishermen had \nto pay the tax in fish to those who had bought the tax right. This direct tax was \nproposed to transfer into an indirect tax by issuing permits for boats. Tax on land \nwas also a direct tax. The authority of tax collection was auctioned and those who \nbought it collected taxes from the products of lands. Colebrooke banished it and \nrecommended to collect an equal amount in cash from all lands.\nColebrooke further recommended the establishment of a savings bank in the island. \nThe purpose of establishing a bank was to allow the entrepreneurs who invest money \non estate cultivation obtain money to a reasonable interest.\n",

Foreign investors could buy thousands \nof acres of land in Sri Lanka because there were no rich people among locals \nwho could invest in mega scales though Colebrooke wanted to encourage private \nentrepreneurship. This was not a secret to Colebrooke too.\nForeigners invested money on trade based agriculture which was profitable in  the \nforeign market. As a result, there was rapid expansion in plantation sector in the \n19th century.\n\uf076 Plantation of  Coffee\nThough coffee plantation began during the Dutch period in small scale in coastal \nareas, because a prominent place was given to cinnamon plantation, coffee plantation \ndid not develop.

When the English came to Kandy, coffee plantation had been done in several places as a home cultivation. It developed into a plantation during the reign of the British. Several factors were there that affected the development of the coffee plantation in the 19th century. Factors that helped the development of the coffee plantation: \u2022 More investment on coffee plantation by foreigners after the Colebrooke reforms in 1833. \u2022 Increasing demand for coffee in the European market.- 69 -\n\u2022 High profit drawn through coffee plantation.\n\u2022 Ability to get cheap labour from the Indian labourers in the plantation sector.\nSome other reasons for the expansion of coffee cultivation were the  reduction of \nexport tax for coffee and releasing of the labourers  who worked in coffee  plantation \nfrom compulsory service system during the time of the governor Edward Barnes \n(from 1824 \u2013 1831).\nCoffee plantation was expanding fast in the upcountry region during the period \nof 1837 -1847. Even the government officers started growing coffee because it was \nvery profitable. Reports say that there were about 500 acres of coffee plantation in \nthe hill county by 1845.  Thus, the coffee plantation was successful in areas such \nas Dumbara valley, Gampola, Peradeniya, Matale, Badulla and many areas of the \nCentral Province. The amount of coffee export in 1844, was five times bigger than \nthat of 1834. But after 1844 Sri Lanka had to face a huge challenge in the Landon \nmarket because of the free trade policy of Britain. Furthermore, the downfall of \nthe global market too affected badly on the coffee plantation of Sri Lanka. Because \nof these reasons the demand for coffee decreased and the value of the coffee lands \nwent down in 1848. But this situation reached normalcy again after 1850 with the \nreduction of production cost through efficient estate management and the high \ndemand for coffee in Europe. The major reason for the downfall of coffee plantation \nin Sri Lanka was the leaf disease that spread since 1869. The fungus which was \ncalled  \u201cHemileia Vastatrix\u201d spread fast destroying the coffee plantation.\n\uf076 Cinchona and Cocoa\nWhen the coffee cultivation began to deteriorate, some planters started growing \ncinchona and cocoa. Yet cinchona became successful in areas with very high \naltitude only. Cinchona was a plant that was used in the production of the medicine \ncalled quinine and it had a limited demand. Therefore, it was not successful as an \nalternative to the coffee plantation.\nWhen the coffee plantation began to deteriorate, the government encouraged \nthe cocoa plantation. Anyway, the planters had to bear an additional expenditure \nbecause cocoa needed shade in order to grow well. Even during the period when \ncocoa had become a successful plantation. It was not spread more than 1200 acres. \nIt was successful only in Matale district. Cocoa too failed to provide an alternative \nto coffee.\n    \n",

Cocoa too failed to provide an alternative to coffee.- 70 -\n\uf076 Tea Plantation\nOther crops were tried in the upcountry areas because of the fluctuation of coffee \nprice in the world market. Several such experiments were made on tea plantation \nalso.  The Planters' Association sent a group of estate workers to Assam to study \nfurther about tea plantation in 1867. At the same time, James Tailor too experimented \ngrowing tea in several areas of Lulkandura estate. Tea plantation spread to about \n500 acres by 1875 as a result of the above mentioned experiments. Tea plantation \nbegan to expand quickly because many planters took to tea plantation due to the \ndestruction of coffee cultivation. By 1894 the amount of tea planted area had reached \nupto 400,000 acres. Tea plantation spread to the Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa \nprovinces because it could be grown in any area with more than 6000 feet of altitude \nexcept in the dry zone of the country. Later it was spread to the Southern and \nWestern provinces too. It is reported that there had been 1200 acres of tea in average \nsize and bigger tea estates in the country by 1930.      \n    \nWith this expansion of tea plantation, tea became one of the major export products \nin our country.

There \nwas an increasing interest on \ncoconut plantation by 1850 due to \nthe fall of coffee prices. A significant \ncharacteristic was the enthusiasm \nshown by the natives than the \nforeigners in the coconut plantation. \nBy 1880, 65% of coconut estate \nowners were Sri Lankans. \nCoconut plantation expanded more in broad flat lands than in the hill country. \nAreas like Kurunegala, Chilaw and Gampaha were prominent among them. By \n1920, 27% of the foreign earnings came from coconut products. A coconut research \ninstitution was established in Lunuwila to develop coconut plantation when the \ncoconut plantation started to expand. It is clear that coconut plantation did not aim \nat export like the other cultivations, owing to the fact that half of the production \nwas utilized for local consumption. Just as roads and railways developed in the hill \ncountry due to tea and coffee plantation, roads in the other parts of the country \nwere developed to support the coconut plantation.\n\uf076 Rubber Plantation\nThough rubber was introduced to Sri Lanka around \n1877, it did not show quick expansion because many \ncultivators during this period were more focused on \ntea plantation. By the beginning of the 20th century, \nrubber plantation expanded because rubber price \nincreased due to the expansion of the motor vehicle \nindutry, suitable rubber species were found for Sri \nLanka together with the development of production \ntechniques and temporary fall of tea prices. Rubber \nplantation which was limited to Kalutara district \nat the beginning later expanded to the Western, \nSabaragamuwa, Southern provinces and some \nparts of the Central Province. By 1920, 30% of the \nexport income was received from rubber products. \nLater a rubber research institution was started in Agalawatta to develop the rubber \nplantation. \n",

They were respected and honoured by the others in the society because of the positions they held. These traditional aristocrats were called as elites. A government agent and the Kandyan leaders A group of new middle class people- 76 -\nThe Colebrooke reforms paved the way to a capitalist economic system in Sri Lanka \nopening several new ways of earning money instead of the traditional earning \nmethods. Among those methods, working as contractors who supplied facilities to \nthe plantation sector, production and distribution of arrack, graphite mining, whole \nsale and retail sale transportation and coconut plantation were the areas in which \nlocals could invest money on. Thus, at the onset of the 20th century, there was a \nlocal wealthy class that earned money by investing money on the above mentioned \nindustries. They spent money to give a good education to their sons and daughters \nlocally as well as internationally. New job opportunities such as lawyers, engineers, \nsurveyors, clerks and civil servants had  emerged by this time. People could demand \na high recognition and better living conditions by getting these jobs through English \neducation. As a result, it became another open door to enter, the middle class.\nThere emerged a group of entrepreneurs that manipulated the new earning ways \nwhich were opened during the British reign as well as an educated group that got posts \nin the government through English education. They were named as the middle class \nbecause they became prominent among the others because they enjoyed a higher \neconomic status. With the emergence of this new middle class at the beginning of \nthe 20th century, the traditional aristocratic group began to fade away. \nThe educated group in the new middle class became politically active. They pioneered \nthe political struggles in the 20th century. This group which was named as educated \nmiddle class was those who earned recognition through western education.  As a \nresult they became a group of rich city dwellers who followed the western culture. \n\uf076 Emergence of a Labour Class\nAnother significant feature of the British reign is the emergence of a labour class \nbecause of the economic reforms that were made. In the traditional administration \nsystem, labour was taken under the compulsory service system for the common \nactivities of the government, leaving no necessity of working for wages. Yet because \nduring the British reign plantation was started in the hill country, labourers were \nneeded to work in estates. Since India too was a colony of Britain by this time, \nbringing labourers from Southern India for a meagre salary was more profitable. \nTherefore, the estate owners brought labourers from India in thousands. As a result \na labour community started to grow in the hill country. \nNew labourers were needed for duties such as loading and unloading goods in \ncities like Colombo, Galle and Kandy, washing clothes, transporting goods by carts, \n",

As a \nresult, a local group of labourers emerged in the city areas in addition to the south \nIndian labourers. \nThey received a meagre salary at the beginning. The number of hours they worked \nwas not set. There were no labour insurance, compensation or other labour welfare \nactivities. As a result, the city labourers started to gather and establish workers\u2019 \nunions in order to win their rights. They started to strike in order to get their status \ndeveloped as they could feel a growing unity among them. Some examples for labour \nstrikes that took place at the beginning of the 20th century are the strike of printers, \nstrike of the Colombo launderers and the carters\u2019 strike.\nBy the third decade of the 20th century the labourers began to organize themselves in \nbetter ways.  Mr. E.A. Gunasinghe is a leader who tried to organize the urban labour \ncommunity in a better way. He became the most renowned leader of labourers from \n1922 to 1935. He pioneered to establish the \u2018Ceylon Workers Congress\u2019 marking a \nlandmark in the history of trade unions in Sri Lanka. The leaders of \u2018Lanka Sama \nSamaja Party\u2019 led labour struggles establishing trade unions. Mr. Natesa Aiiar led \nthe establishment of trade unions among the estate labourers. \n\uf076 Changes in the Culture\nThe Sri Lankan culture experienced heavy changes during the British reign  parallel \nto the changes in the society. The most significant change was the spreading of \nwestern culture in the country. The western education and studying of English \nlanguage began to spread fast in the country after the Colebrooke reforms. It was \nthe foreigners that prepared the curricula and conducted teaching in missionary \nschools and state aided schools. These schools too paved the way for the spreading \nof western culture in the country. Some aspects of the western culture invaded Sri \nLanka through the behaviour of those who went to western countries for education. \nMore Europeans were attracted to Sri Lanka during the 19th century because of the \nexpansion of plantations, development of trade and the improvements of transport \nand communication that took place in the country. As a result their clubs, holiday \nresorts started to mushroom in the country accelerating the spreading of western \nculture. As a result of these western dresses, customs and traditions, greetings, \nwestern architecture and their food started to mix into the culture of Sri Lanka.\n",

Thus, Sri Lanka had been \nexploited for 133 years by the British. During this time they earned a vast wealth \nfrom the island to take to their country and used all resources of the island for their \nwell being. Even under such conditions, there were certain benefits that the island \ncould enjoy. Some examples are;\n\u2022 Spreading of English language in the island which was an international language\n\u2022 Development of transport and communication\n\u2022 Introduction of export plantation\n\u2022 Good effects of industrial revolution\n\u2022 Parliamentary system\n5.4  Disadvantages\nThough there were some advantages of being a colony of British there were many \nproblems by the time Sri Lanka received independence after being exploited for \n133 years by a foreign empire. Although some citizens became wealthy during \nthis period the majority of the people were touching the depth of poverty when \nindependence was won. Thus, there was a vast disparity in distribution of income \nand an immediate need had arisen to increase public service and welfare. Some \nmore disadvantages of staying a colony are;\n\u2022 spreading of western culture and deterioration of indigenous culture\n\u2022 spreading of alcohol consumption\n\u2022 emergence of a landless social group\n\u2022 downfall of self sufficient economic system and losing of indigenous knowledge\n\u2022 destruction of useful institutions such as village councils (Gamsabha) \n",

At the same time Sri Lanka got the parliamentary system allowing its people \nto join politics through the representative democracy. New changes occurred in the \npolitical system with the introduction of new constitutions in 1972 and 1978. This \nlesson focuses on the special features of the political system and the trends in the \nsocial and economic systems during the few decades after independence.\n6.1  Soulbury Reforms and Independence\nThe members of the Soulbury Commission that was appointed to investigate \ninto Sri Lanka\u2019s constitutional reforms and give proposals came to Sri Lanka in \nDecember 1944. They published their report in September, 1945 and a constitution \nthat would give all powers of internal affairs to the Sri Lankans had been suggested \nin it. Britain issued the royal order of the Soulbury Constitution in May, 1946 \nafter the State Council passed the white paper which included the proposals of \nthe Soulbury Commission report. Though the first election to be held under the \nSoulbury constitution was scheduled in mid 1947, Britain was reluctant to issue any \nstatement about Sri Lanka\u2019s independence. Because of that the Sri Lankan leaders \nlike D.S. Senanayake logically presented their views on the right of Sri Lankans \nfor independence, to the British. As a result, the secretary of colonies made an \nannouncement two months before the election, declaring independence for Sri \nLanka within the Commonwealth Nations. By this time, the United National Party \nhad been established by Mr. D.S. Senanayake. The results of the 1947 parliamentary \nelection are given below.\n",

The new Prime Minister, D.S. \nSenanayake understood this intention and signed two agreements on security and \nexternal affairs with the British government in November, 1947.\nUnder the defence convention, it was agreed that the British could use Sri Lankan \nterritory for naval, air and other military purposes when necessary. Under the \nexternal affairs convention, the British agreed to provide Sri Lanka with necessary \nassistance in building relationships with other countries as an independent country. \nAfter that the Independence Act of Sri Lanka was passed in the British parliament \nincluding the statements to grant independence to Sri Lanka. The royal order on \nthe independence of Sri Lanka including statements to put the act into operation \nwas issued on the 19th of December 1947.

Thus, 4th of February became the independence day of Sri Lanka.\n\uf076 Soulbury Constitution\nThe Soulbury constitution came into action after the Donoughmore constitution \nthat functioned from 1931-1947. It lasted till the Republican constitution of 1972 \ncame into action. The Soulbury constitution introduced four institutions for the \nfunctioning of the government as, the governor general and the cabinet of ministers \nheaded by the prime minister, the parliament and the judiciary.\n\uf076 The Governor General\nThe post of governor which existed up to 1947 was discontinued and a governor \ngeneral was appointed to represent the British throne even under the new \nconstitution, the queen of Britain was accepted as the ruler of Sri Lanka and the \ngovernor general acted as the local representative of the queen. The post of the \ngovernor general was completely a nominal executive post and had to take advice of \nthe prime minister in all situations.\n\uf076 The Parliament\nUnder the Soulbury constitution, there was a legislature which consisted of a senate \nand a court of members of parliament. The court of members or the representative \nmembers consisted of 101 members.

The administration of court judges were done by \nthe Judiciary Service Commission headed by the Chief Justice.\n\uf076 Political Party System in Sri Lanka\nPolitical party system can be seen in all countries where the parliamentary democracy \nexists. There were only two major parties in countries like England and America at \nthe beginning. This is called as dual-party system. In European countries such as \nFrance, Germany as well as the Asian countries such as India, Sri Lanka several \npolitical parties can be seen. This system is called as the multi-party system.\nBecause of the political party system, it has become easy to organize people under \nthe principles of each party and to pass their opinion among people. The party \nsystem is necessary to build the relationship between politicians and voters because \nthe parliamentary system is an administration in which a country is governed by the \nrepresentatives of people.\nThe political party system in Sri Lanka began during the British reign. Though the \nuniversal franchise was given to Sri Lanka in 1937, until 1947, the political party \nsystem was not considered in elections. The political party system came into action \nin Sri Lanka in the election of 1947. By that election, political parties such as Lanka \nSama Samaja Party, United National Party, Lanka Communist Party and Tamil \nCongress were functioning.\n",

The political party system came into action in Sri Lanka in the election of 1947. By that election, political parties such as Lanka Sama Samaja Party, United National Party, Lanka Communist Party and Tamil Congress were functioning.- 83 -\n\uf076 Lanka Sama Samaja Party\nThe Lanka Sama Samaja Party is considered as one of the oldest parties in Sri Lanka. \nThe leaders like Dr. N.M. Perera, Dr. Kolvin R. de Silva, Mr. Philip Gunawardana \nwho went abroad for education learnt about leftist politics in those countries and \nestablished  the Lanka Sama Samaja Party in Sri Lanka in 1935 to implement such \npolitics in a way  suitable to Sri Lanka. The prime objective of the Lanka Sama \nSamaja Party was to create a communist society in Sri Lanka according to the \ndoctrine of leftist political points of view. Later a fraction of the Lanka Sama Samaja \nParty headed by Dr. S. A. Wickramasinghe established the Lanka Communist Party \nin 1943.\n\uf076 United National Party\nThough by 1946, there were several leftist parties and minority parties, there was \nno party for the politicians who had neutral ideas. The United National Party \nwas started in 1946 under the leadership of Mr. D.S. Senanayake because the first \nparliamentary election was scheduled in 1947. The majority of the members of the \nLanka National Congress and the Sinhala Maha Sabha headed by Mr. S. W. R. D. \nBandaranayake joined the United National Party. As a result, it became a powerful \npolitical party from the beginning. They were able to win 42 seats by presenting 95 \ncontesters. They were able to establish a government in1952 by winning 54 seats in \nthe second parliamentary election.\n\uf076 Sri Lanka Freedom Party\nMr. S. W. R. D. Bandaranayake broke away from the United National Party and \nestablished Sri Lanka Freedom Party in 1951. This party paid more attention on \nthe necessities  of general public than the UNP and was able to win the support \nof the vernacular scholars, monks and those who valued nationalism. The party \nthat won only 9 seats in the 1951 parliamentary election contested as the Mahajana \nEksath Peramuna by aligning with several other parties and was able to establish \nthe government in 1956 election by securing 51 seats. Mr. Bandaranayake  was \nthe Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 1956 to 1959. After the assassination of Mr. \nBandaranayake, his wife Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake  became the leader of the \nparty.\n",

After the assassination of Mr. Bandaranayake, his wife Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranayake became the leader of the party.- 84 -\n\uf076 Other Political Parties\nOther than the above parties that presented candidates around the country in \nelections, there were several parties which were in function. The Labour Party \npioneered by Mr. A. E. Gunasinghe and the Tamil Congress started by Mr. G. G. \nPonnambalam are some examples for such parties. Among them the Tamil Congress \nheld a significant place until the 1956 election. They who paid special attention on \nthe rights of the Tamil people in this country were able to secure 07 seats in the \n1947 election. It seems that the Tamil Congress lost its public support when Mr. J. V. \nChelvanayagam started the Federal Party in 1949.\nAccording to the political party system that exists in Sri Lanka there are a number \nof minor parties other than the two major parties like United National Party and Sri \nLanka Freedom Party. Because of that, there can be situations in which no party can \nclaim a majority in an election. As a result several parties have to come together and \nmake political aligns to establish a coalitional government.\n\uf076 1956 Election and the Social Change\nThe United National Party which was in power continuously after the independence \nwas defeated in 1956 and a new government was established under the leadership \nof S.W. R.D. Bandaranayake. It is believed that a social revolution was made by that \ngovernment because several new forces were rallied round Mr. Bandaranayake to \nfollow a policy of valuing the native language, religion and culture and to attempt to \nsolve some unresolved social and economic problems. \nBecause Mr. D.S. Senanayake who became the Prime Minister in the 1947 election \ndied in March, 1952, his son Dudley Senanayake became the Prime Minister. \nHe became the Prime Minister again in 1952 because the United National Party \nwon that election too. But he resigned from his portfolio in 1953 because of the \nremonstrations that were staged by the leftist parties in protest of rising price of \nrice and other food items. Then, another senior member of  United National Party, \nMr. John Kothalawala became the Prime Minister. Though the next parliamentary \nelection was scheduled  in  May 1957, the Governor General dissolved the parliament \nin February 1956 as instructed by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Kothalawala. As a \nresult there was another election in the country. \nIn the 1956 election, the United National Party contested as a single party where \n",

M. R. A. Eeriyagolla \ncame together in forming the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna. The Mahajana Eksath \nPeramuna had entered into a no contest agreement with the Lanka Sama Samaja \nParty and it became advantageous for both the parties.\nThe major issue discussed in the 1956 election stage was the policy of making Sinhala \nthe official language. Even after obtaining independence, English language held a \nspecial position and it became problematic for the vernacular scholars. Because of \nthat, those who rallied round the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna had already accepted \nSinhala naming as the state language as a policy. The United National Party too \nagreed with this policy when the election came at hand.\nThe Mahajana Eksath Peramuna won the election easily because of the support of \nthe Pancha Maha Balavega; monks , doctors , teachers , farmers  and labourers  were \nwith them. At the same time, fighting as an align signing a no contest agreement with \nthe leftist parties further helped them to win. They secured 51 seats and the Lanka \nSama Samaja Party got 14 seats.

The \nindependence Sri Lanka received under this constitution was not complete because \nstill the queen of Britain was considered the leader of the country and there were \ncertain restrictions for the parliament to follow in imposing laws. As a result, the \nnecessity of a new constitution was felt during the time of the Soulbury Commission. \nA successful attempt was made for that with the 1970 election.\nA united align had been established to face the 1970 election by the Sri Lanka \nFreedom Party, the Lanka Sama Samaja party and the Communist Party.

Fig 6.4 Supreme Court- 92 -\nThe Judiciary Service Commission was appointed to protect the freedom of the \njudiciary and to protect the impartiality of judges. The Chief Justice is the head \nof the commission including two more judges of the Supreme Court as members. \nThe Judiciary Service Commission is responsible about the transfers of high court \njudges, training of judiciary officers, promotions and discipline of them.\n\uf076 Fundamental Rights\nThe third chapter of the 1978 constitution explains the fundamental rights. This \nconstitution broadly and in detail explains the fundamental rights than the 1972 \nconstitution did.\nAmong the fundamental rights mentioned in the constitution, equal rights for \njudiciary procedures, freedom of speech  and opinion , right of being free of \nharassment,  freedom of religion and freedom of profession are included.\nThe 1978 constitution goes beyond the 1972 constitution to mention in its statement \n129 that a person can forward a petition to the Supreme Court within three months \nof such violation of fundamental rights or comprehensive freedom. If such violations \nare true, the supreme court gives judgments about it.\nThe constitution includes provisions for a person to make a complaint to the \nparliamentary commissioner or the ombudsman when the rights of a person who \nworks in the government or cooperation are limited or obstructed.\nTypes of elections mentioned in the 1978 constitution;\n\uf076 Presidential Election \nSri Lanka becomes one whole electorate in the presidential election. The candidate \nwho can obtain a 50% majority or a definite majority is declared the winner.\nMr. J. R. Jayewardene who was the Prime Minister in 1978 was nominated the \nfirst executive president in Sri Lanka. Then a presidential election was held  in \n1982. Mr. J. R. Jayewardene was elected the president again  in this election. The \nsecond amendment to the 1978 constitution declared  that the president could go \nfor an election requesting power for a second session once four years out of six \nhave already passed.

This method is used in all elections including parliamentary, provincial \ncouncil and the other local government elections.\nCandidates face this type of elections in groups. The number of members elected for \neach electorate is announced before the election and the voters have to first vote for \nthe party and  mark the preferences for the candidates. The number of seats for each \nparty is determined  according to the proportion of votes they take and candidates \nare selected following the number of preference votes they get.\n\uf076 Referendum\nReferendum is a way of getting the people's opinion directly on matters with national \nimportance. The concept of referendum was first introduced in 1978 constitution. \nHere, the people\u2019s discretion is marked by answering a \u201cyes or no\u201d question. The \nonly referendum of the history of Sri Lanka was held in 1982. It was held to get the \nperiod of existing parliament extended.\nThere should be more than 50%  of the cast votes to declare that the people have \ngiven their consent to the matter on discussion.\n6.2  Development  after Independence\nAfter the independence in 1948 politicians of this country had the responsibility \nof handling the economy of the  country that had been used for the benefit of the \nBritish colonists for the betterment of the people.

During the four decades after the independence , the two major parties of Sri Lanka , the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party were in power and they tried to develop the economy of Sri Lanka. They had tried several ways to develop the agriculture , industries and the education of the country.- 94 -\n\uf076 Development of Agriculture \nThe food needed for the people was produced within the country because Sri Lanka \nhad been an agricultural country from the past. Yet, the British administration that \nlasted for 133 years paid attention to  state  plantation and did not pay enough \nattention to the local agriculture. The English  imported the necessary food items to \nSri Lanka during their reign.  As a result, by the time Sri Lanka got the independence, \na need had arisen to develop the production of food items within the country. Hence, \nevery government had to take steps to develop paddy cultivation.\n\uf076 Development of Paddy Cultivation \nTowards the latter part of the British reign in Sri Lanka, they had to pay attention to \ndeveloping the agriculture in Sri Lanka because of the difficulty of exporting food \ndue to the World War 1 and increasing food prices due to the economic demise  in \n1929.  Yet the most productive attempt was made during the period of the State \nCouncil (1931\u20131947). The reasons for the development of the paddy cultivation \nduring that era were appointing a Sri Lankan minister for the ministry of agriculture \nunder the Donoughmore constitution and Mr. D. S. Senanayake who had an interest \nto develop the agriculture becoming the Minister of Agriculture.\nThe flat and rich soil that was more suitable for paddy cultivation exists in the dry \nzone of the country and therefore , that area should be used for paddy cultivation \nagain. Therefore Mr. D. S. Senanayake started establishing farming settlements in \nthe dry zone.\n\uf076 Establishment of Farming Settlements\nObjectives of establishing farming settlements: \n\u2022 Reducing the increasing population and unemployment in the wet zone.\n\u2022 Improving the food production of the country.\n \u2022 Using the land of the dry zone for economic development by repairing the old \nlakes and irrigations of the dry zone.\n \u2022 Providing a solution to the competition for the land in wet zone and creating a \nsatisfied landed farming community.\n",

As a solution to the major problem  that arose in the \narea, lack of water, our ancestors built a network of lakes and irrigations. But , after \nthe invasion  of Kalinga Magha people had immigrated to the wet zone from the dry \nzone. Using thus given up dry zone again for paddy  cultivation after 700 years was \na landmark of the development of paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka.\n Challenges the government faced in establishing new farming settlements:\n\u2022 Selecting people from the wet zone and making them settle in houses in the dry \nzone.\n\u2022 Supporting people to turn the lands that had been forests for a long time into \nfarm land and  supplying irrigation facilities.\n\u2022 Providing the settlers with financial assistance till they get their first harvest.\n\u2022 Arranging health and education facilities for people.\n\u2022 Establishment of sales promotion programmes for the sale of products.\nSeveral farming settlements could be started even before independence because \nthere were effective  plans to lay out necessary rules to overcome the difficulties. \nSome examples for such settlements were Kagama, Minneriya, Nachchaduwa, \nBeragama, Minipe, Parakrama Samudraya, Ridi Bedi Ella, Sangili Kanadarawa  and \nOnichchei. After independence till about 1953, 15 more farming settlements were \nestablished. Bathmadika, Deva Huwa, Girithale, Paniyankadawala, Iranamadu, Gal \nOya, Kantale, Soraborawewa were such settlements.\nWith these new farming settlements there was great enthusiasm in the country to \nreconstruct lakes and building of irrigation. Galoya project is an example for that. It \nis the first multi-purpose development project started in Sri Lanka. \n\uf076 Mahaweli Project\nThe Mahaweli project  takes an important place among the projects launched \ntargeting the economic development of the country after the independence.

So there was a stable market \nfor rubber products of the country. \nThe government started a new project of giving aids to the landowners for re-\nplantation of rubber in 1977. There, rubber plants and fertilizers were given. Later, \nthis was extended to tea plantation too. \nA special feature is the emergence of a group of small scale landowners as a result of \nthe distribution of land continued by the government after gaining independence. \nAs a result, a group of landowners who owned lands between 1-10 acres of tea and \nrubber emerged in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa provinces.  With this \nthe income of villagers in relation to major export crops increased.\n\uf076 Development of Small Scale Export Crops\nSteps were taken after gaining independence to develop the small scale export crops \nsuch as; coffee, cocoa, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, pepper, cinnamon in addition to \nthe major crops such as tea, rubber and coconut.\nIn 1968, according to the Tea Commission reports cultivation of some minor scale \nexport crops was encouraged as additional cultivations. \nA minor scale export research institution was started in Matale in 1972.

Some attention was paid on the industrial sector when labour industries- 102 -\nand trade ministries were given to Sri Lankans under Donoughmore reforms. The \nSri Lanka Bank Commission that investigated into the status of the Sri Lankan \nindustries in 1934 had recommended starting industries to provide industrial \nproducts to the local market. \nThere were problems in exporting goods to Sri Lanka during the World War II \nwhich began in 1939. Products like acetic acid, porcelain products, paper, soup and \nperfumes were produced and they had good demand. Those industries suffered \ndrawbacks because they were unable to compete with the exported products that \nbegan to flow back to Sri Lanka after World War II.\nA group of World Bank representatives that came to Sri Lanka in 1952 pointed out \nthe importance of   starting small scale industries with the help of the government. \nThere was enthusiasm to invest money on industries because the government \nmade their policy on foreign and private investment clear in the 1955 white paper \nwhich was issued after the report of the World Bank representatives. After that, \nthe establishment of the first industrial zone in Ekala in 1959 and the Ratmalana \nindustrial zone in 1960 became the landmarks in the policy of industrialization. \nSome Landmarks of the Industrial Field after 1960:\n \u2022 Establishment of People\u2019s Bank in 1961 and providing the small scale industrialists \nwith loan facilities.\n \u2022 Establishment of a standard bureau to decide the standard of local industrial \nproducts in 1966.\n \u2022 Development of industries that produced local consumer goods due to the \ngovernment industrial policy after 1960.\n \u2022 Development of local home industries and minor scale industries due to the \nexport substitution policy of the government during 1970\u20131977.\nExport substitution policy means producing alternative local products instead of \nthe products that were exported. \n \u2022 The government started to continue mega scale industries in vast factories that \nused raw materials in mega scale in the three decades after obtaining \n \nindependence.

The number of schools in the country rapidly increased because \nthere arose a desire for education in the minds of Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim \npeople during the religious and national renaissance. The children of the poor \ncould enjoy little benefits of education because of the financial difficulties they \nhad when pursuing higher education. Because of this free education policy which \nprovided free education from grade 1 to university was launched as proposed by Mr. \nC.W.W. Kannangara who was the Minister of Education in the State Council. Every \ngovernment that came to power after that, continued the free education policy. \nSome landmarks of education after 1948 are given below;\n\u2022 Increasing the number of schools around the country by establishing government \nschools and spending money on education project\n\u2022 Curriculum development and renovations in teacher training\n\u2022 Expansion of laboratory and library facilities\n\u2022 Free supply of textbooks, lunch, medical and dental care services, \nschool uniforms and the improvement of student welfare and support through \nconcessionary transport facilities\n\u2022 Timely changes in education administration\n\u2022  Expansion of professional education\n\u2022 Improvement of higher education by establishing new universities \n\u2022 Establishment of Ceylon University in 1942 in Colombo\n\u2022 Shifting the Ceylon University to Peradeniya in 1952\n\u2022 Transforming the Vidyodaya and Vidyalankara pirivenas to universities.  \n \nLater, they were named as Sri Jayawardanapura University and Kelaniya \nUniversity respectively.\n\u2022 Establishment of Moratuwa Katubedda University in 1972 and Jaffna University \nin 1974 \n",

Politicians started looking into the necessities of the \ngeneral public because it became a major factor in capturing political power. There \nhad been several social problems that affected the lives of the general public badly \ndue to the fact that Sri Lanka had been a colony for a long time. A significant feature \nin the government policy was to bring back social justice and annihilate inequality \nby providing solutions to the long lasting social problems. Some examples for the \nprojects that were launched to bring back social justice after 1948 are,\n\u2022 development of education in rural areas\n \u2022 giving priority to the achievements and following competitive examination \nsystem in giving jobs\n \u2022 constitutionalizing of concepts such as; freedom, sovereignty and fundamental \nrights\n \u2022 provision of government support to agriculture and fisheries industry through \nloan schemes and concessionaries\n\uf076 Health Service\nThough free health facilities were available in Sri Lanka even before independence, \nthey were limited to city areas. So, special attention was paid on developing health \nfacilities in rural areas after gaining independence. Some examples for the steps taken \nto improve rural health facilities are establishment of rural hospitals, development \nof midwifery, maternity and paediatric health services, immunization, conducting \nmedical clinics and improving indigenous medicine etc. As a result, the number \nthat suffered from diseases such as; influenza, phylaria, malaria, tuberculosis, polio \nwent down dramatically. \n\uf076 Other Welfare Facilities\nTravel and transport of the country developed during the British rule because they \nbuilt roads and railways. After the independence, rural roads were developed so that \nthe benefits of the above mentioned transport facilities trickled down to the villages \nalso. As a result, the distance between the village and the city shortened and the \nfacilities that were limited to the cities such as water, electricity and communication \nreached the villages too. \n",

Georgia- 108 -\nThe colonization in North America that began with the establishment of Virginia \nState in 1607 by the British continued for about a century. A significant characteristic \nis the interference of individuals, groups of people and companies rather than the \ndirect influence of the British government in the colonization of America. The \nBritish government gave its approval and assistance in colonization. The British who \nwent to Northern America had established thirteen estates by 1733. Their names are \ngiven above.\nTwelve estates out of those thirteen were started between 1607 and 1682. The last \nBritish colony among those thirteen was Georgia. It was established in 1733. The \nnature of the first states shows that they were not started at the same time. The \nreasons for their start were also different. One reason for the establishment of these \nstates was the expectation of religious freedom and commercial benefits. Differences \nexisted among these states with regard to composition of population, life style and \neconomic matters. Nevertheless, they began to rise as a separate English speaking \ncommunity by the mid 18th century.\n\uf076 American States and the British Administration\nIt was mentioned above that the colonies were established in North America by \nBritish companies and different individuals\u2019 interference. Those who started \ncolonies took a warrant from the British government. There, they had to work under \nseveral conditions. Some of them were the acceptance of the authority of the British \ngovernment and imposing the same laws that were in Britain, in the new colonies. \nStates were ruled by a governor appointed to each state. There was a legislative \ncouncil elected from each state to assist the governor. The state citizens followed a \nlocal self governance system because of the long distance between the two countries \nand the absence of a developed communication system. The reasons for this are \nthat the colonies were situated far away from the mother country and Britain could \nnot pay much attention to colonies as it was involved in various battles in Europe. \nHence, till about 1763 Britain followed a flexible political policy regarding American \nstates. This led to the development of thoughts about freedom in the minds of state \ncitizens. Yet, they needed the assistance of Britain because they still had to face some \nproblems. \nThe settlers of American colonies had to face two problems regarding their security \nbefore 1763.

This led to the development of thoughts about freedom in the minds of state citizens. Yet, they needed the assistance of Britain because they still had to face some problems. The settlers of American colonies had to face two problems regarding their security before 1763. The first was the threat of the French. The settlers of the colonies wanted the protection of the British because the French power was there to the north of the- 109 -\nBritish colonies and they tried to consolidate their power. There was a war between \nthe British and the French between 1756 and 1763. It is called the seven year war. \nFrance was defeated in this war. The American colonists became free of the France's \nthreat because Britain and France signed a treaty of peace. The main obstacle that \ndisturbed the expansion of the American colonies to west was the Red Indians. \nWhen the French were powerful they had connection with the French against the \nBritish. This situation changed with the defeat of France. After that the policies \ncontinued by the British were able to minimize the threat of the Red Indians.\nAmericans no longer needed the British assistance regarding its protection because \nthe power of France was lost when they were defeated in the seven year war and the \nRed Indians\u2019 threat was diminished with new defence strategies.\n\uf076 Reasons for the Freedom Struggle\nThe British economic policy and commercial activities were continued in a way that \nwas beneficial to Britain. Thus, it was prohibited to produce in states, things that \nwere produced in Britain. Apart from that, tobacco, sugar, cotton, bee vax corn, \nbronze that were produced in the states should only be sold to Britain. The other \nproducts were also allowed to export only via Britain. Further, there was a condition \nthat the states should not compete with Britain regarding production or trade. \nThough these policies brought economic disadvantages to the people in states, they \ngot a stable market because of Britain. On the other hand, because the British laws \ndid not function too strictly in the colonies, they could engage in illegal transactions \nwith other nations and reduce their losses. Because of the above reasons there was \nno strong protest against the British economic system and laws in American states \ntill about 1763. Yet, because of the new laws introduced by Britain after 1763, there \nwere disparities between the two countries. This generated new ideas about freedom. \nBritain had to bear a huge cost in the seven year war and as a result of it their debts \nincreased. The British believed that the American states too should bear a part of \nthose debts and interest. Therefore, the British Prime Minister, George Granville \ndecided to systemize tax collection in the American states. He tightened the naval \npatrol in order to stop illegal transactions. More tax bills were passed to increase the \nincome that was gained from America. Three bills that were passed between 1764 \nand 1765 were;\n1. \nSugar Act\n2. \nCurrency Note Act\n3. \nStamp Act\n",

More tax bills were passed to increase the income that was gained from America. Three bills that were passed between 1764 and 1765 were; 1. Sugar Act 2. Currency Note Act 3. Stamp Act- 110 -\nAccording to the Sugar Act, more British naval forces were sent to the coastal areas \nresulting in fights between people and the naval officers. The Currency Note Act \nprohibited issuing of currency notes by states to pay debts. As a result, the people in \nstates had to pay debts in gold or silver. While there were increasing protests against \nthese two acts by the people in states, Britain passed a Stamp Bill on 1765. According \nto this act a tax was charged from all printed documents and warrants. The stamp \nlevy affected the high class people in American society such as traders, lawyers \nand printers and they started organizing protests. There were increasing protests \nagainst this act and the people in America refused to pay the stamp levy. People \nunited in organizing these protests against the levies on tea, glass, paper other than \nthe above mentioned taxes. In another bill passed in Britain, the American states \nwere ordered to provide accommodation and financial allocation for the British \nforces that were placed in America. When people started protests against these acts, \nBritain started to use repressive actions such as dissolving of constitutional councils \netc. Therefore, the Americans started to organize and struggle for independence. \nWhen this situation is summarized, several reasons for the American revolution \ncan be identified.\n\uf076 Reasons for the American Revolution\n\uf034\ufffd Americans were used to a self governing system with less interference from \nBritain.\n\uf034\ufffd The economic policy followed by Britain which was more beneficial for Britain \nitself.\n\uf034\ufffd The British government\u2019s inability to understand the expectation of those who \nlived in states.\n\uf034\ufffd New laws and bills passed after 1763\n\uf034\ufffd Britain\u2019s attempt to suppress the reasonable struggle of the people in states.\n\uf034\ufffd The desire for freedom among the people in states.  \n\uf076 Struggle for Freedom\nStruggles that arose against the new acts and taxes imposed by the British after 1763 \nkindled a desire for freedom among the people who lived in states.

The strongest protest came against the stamp levy. There, the struggle developed to refuse not only stamps but also British products. According to the tradition in Britain those days, the power of imposing taxes was exercised by the parliament. The people in states believed that the British parliament had no power to impose taxes for their country- 111 -\nbecause no member from states represented the parliament. This idea quickly \npassed over to the American states and the slogan \u201cno member, no tax\u201d came out. \nThat became the slogan of the American freedom struggle. The protests that came \nout against economic matters thus became a political issue.\nThe British cancelled the Stamp Act because of the protests that came against it. But, \nthey declared that the British government had the power to impose laws regarding \nthe American states. The British government which understood that the Americans \nwere against the direct taxes like stamp levy, imposed several custom duties in 1767 \nin order to get their income increased. Thus, custom duties were imposed upon \nitems such as glass, lead, paper, tea which were imported to America. Several fights \noccurred because of the attempt of Britain to obtain these taxes and the protests \nwere staged by the people in states against those attempts. Five people died in Boston \nwhen the British forces fired at such a protest campaign. Because of such acts, bitter \nfeelings about Britain emerged in the minds of the Americans. Britain had to suffer \nheavy losses than the income they got because the people in the states boycotted the \nBritish products. Therefore, all taxes were abolished except the tax on tea in 1770. \nThe tax on tea continued to prove the British power to impose taxes for America \nrather than to get an income. \nIn another bill passed in 1773, Britain gave power to one company to supply tea \nto American states. This created trouble to the traditional tea sale of the American \ntraders. Some Americans who were furious about this decision obstructed the trade \ncompanies to unload tea in America.\nIn December 1773, Boston citizens who entered under disguise a ship with tea that \nhad docked in Boston harbour threw 342 tea containers into the sea. This incident \nwhich is known as the \u2018Boston Tea Party\u2019 is believed to be the beginning of the \nAmerican revolution. In reply to this, the British took steps to close down the \nBoston harbour till the loss of tea was compensated. In addition to that, they took \nsteps to reform the administration of Massachusetts and Georgia states by imposing \nlaws without taking the ideas of the people into consideration.

Further \nproposals were passed to boycott the British products and to make people of states \narmed for their security. After this, the battle between the British government and \nAmerican states intensified. Many people died in an armed battle between the forces \nof the two parties in 1775 in Lexington, America. Later the state representatives \ngot together in Philadelphia again and decided to organize state soldiers as a \ncontinental force. George Washington was appointed the commander of that army. \nA committee was appointed in this meeting to obtain foreign aid for the American \nfreedom struggle. \nAfter setting the background to face the British forces, the united representative \nbureau issued the statement of America\u2019s independence on the 4th of July 1776. \nThis document exclaimed that human beings have rights from birth that cannot \nbe deprived of and they establish governments to protect them and declared the \nindependence of America. The British did not agree with this and started war against \nthe American states. These battles continued for several years. During the first two \nyears of the fights, the British forces became victorious. But, after some time they \nbegan to fail.

Some of the privileges enjoyed by them were; \uf034\ufffd permission to fish and hunt in any place of the country. \uf034\ufffd farmers were to go to the grinding mills, wine presses, bakeries owned by- 117 -\naristocrats for their requirements and they had to pay very high charges.\n\uf034\ufffd the aristocrats could collect tax from the lands of farmers.\n\uf034\ufffd they were exempted from government taxes.\nIt was the middle class that was educated and rich in the French society. Yet they \ndid not have proper recognition for their status. Though they were educated, all \ngovernment posts were given to uneducated, inefficient aristocrats. Because of this \nsituation, there emerged a concept that one\u2019s standard should be measured based \non their ability and wealth not on their birth. This provided the background for \nthe emergence of the concept of equality and it later laid the foundation for the \ndemocracy.      \nAmong the under privileged in France the most suffered groups were farmers. They \nrepresented 92% of the French population. They though owned some land and \nworked very hard, had to pay taxes to inefficient aristocrats, were suppressed by \nheavy taxes and cost of living.\n \uf076 Economic Conditions that led to the French Revolution\nBy the time of the revolution, the French treasury was completely bankrupt. Some \nreasons for that were,\n\uf034the excessive expenditure for the luxurious lives of the king and his family\n\uf034unnecessary expenditure for war\nFrance had to bear losses because of the seven year war with Britain and supporting \nthe American freedom struggle.\n\uf034Inefficient tax system\nThe heavy taxes were another reason for the French revolution. The general public \nof France had to pay about 60% of their income as tax. There were so many types of \ntaxes that made people suffer. Taille, Gabelle and Capitation are three examples for \nsuch taxes.\n\uf034 Taille \u2013 A levy charged on houses and lands of the general public. This was \ndifferent from area to area.

Cities like Lion and Paris were free of this tax.- 118 -\n\uf034\nGabelle - This was charged on salt. Every adult had to buy seven pounds of \nsalt every year. The price of salt differed from area to area. Because of that, salt \nwas transported illegally from areas where salt was cheap to areas where salt \nwas expensive. The transportation of salt was a government monopoly and \nthousands of people who transported salt illegally were imprisoned.\n\uf034\nCapitation \u2013 This was introduced in 1695 as a levy charged from everybody. \nBut when in function, the cost had to be completely borne by the general \npublic.\nBecause of the area based administration system in France, laws and taxes were \ndifferent from area to area. This situation became an obstacle to local and foreign \ntrade and economic development of France. The middle class people who were \nengaged in trade had to pay high taxes due to these taxes, laws and regulations. It is \nreported that a water vessel that carried wine from southern France to Paris had to \npay taxes at 40 places and for that purpose they had to spend additional two weeks \nin addition to the cost. There was no security for the money invested by middle \nclass people because the state treasury was bankrupt. This was an obstacle for the \ndevelopment of the middle class. The middle class expected an economic system \nfree from government interference. But the French monarchy failed to provide the \nefficient administration on economic security expected by the middle class. Those \nwere the reasons for the middle class to lead the revolution.\n\uf076 Philosophical Ideas that helped the Revolution\nFig 7.10 Montesquieu\nThe emerging bitter feelings against the monarchy were \ncatalyzed by French philosophical ideas.

A reform \nin taxes was necessary to settle that situation. The king had to summon the council \ncalled, States General Council. There were problems on   the agenda of the meeting \nbecause the bureau had not met for 175 years. The representatives of aristocrats, \npriests and general public were there in the council. Nevertheless, the aristocrats \ndemanded that they and the priests should meet as a noble board. They wanted to \nget together with the priests and defeat the proposals of the lower class people. The \nking also agreed to this but the lower class people disagreed. Because of this crisis \nthe third class which represented the general public met separately.\nThe third class which called themselves the National Bureau gathered in an indoor \ntennis court and took oaths not to dismiss until a new constitution has been designed \nfor France because the king closed the hall where the aristocrats met due to their \ninfluence.

People had to suffer a lot because Russia too took part in World War I. Because of that the theme of the revolution was; peace, land and food. Two revolutions occurred under these themes in March- 122 -\nand October 1917. Let\u2019s now probe deep into this revolution which developed with \nthe purpose of creating a society with no class boundaries.\n\uf076 Reasons for the Revolution\nBy the 20th century in Russia as well as in France, a corrupted dictating monarchy \nexisted. Tsars who became the kings of Russia worked according to anointed kingship. \nThey believed that kingship was granted to them by god and led a corrupted ruling \nsystem paying attention only to their needs. People were made to suffer by charging \ntaxes in order to increase the income of the government. The kings who followed \nthe anointed kingship paid more attention to religion without trying to solve the \neconomic and social problems of the people.\nWhen the economic and social system of Russia was considered, it seemed that \nthere existed an agricultural economic system based on a feudal social system. Land \nwas inherited by aristocrats. Farmers who were the general public of the country, \nfarmers had to work like slaves. Aristocrats were the rich and slaves were considered \na part of their wealth. Farmers had to suffer a lot because they had to pay a part \nof their harvest earned by cultivating the land of aristocrats as tax to the church, \ngovernment and aristocrats. A labour community had emerged as a result of the \nindustrialization that spread in Russia by the 19th century. Anyway, their condition \nwas better than that of farmers. But they were a small minority. The middle class was \nalso a minority and most of them were government servants. While this situation \nwas existing in Russia they lost the war with Japan in 1904 and 1905. It was one of \nthe closest reasons to rise a rebellion against the government in 1905. This rebellion \nagainst the government that was started as farmers\u2019 rebellions and labour strikes \nwas joined by the rebels of the navy. Though the rebels could not win this fight, it \nbecame a good omen for a struggle against the government.\nThough Tsars made some political reforms understanding that people were rising \nagainst the government, people were not satisfied with that and started launching \nstruggles again. There the king ignored the protests and started repressing people. \nBecause of that, the Bolshevik party which was led by Lenin, the leader of rebels \nstepped out of the council called Duma and started to function secretly. At the same \ntime, World War I was started in 1914. Russia too joined in it as a part of allied \nforces. Russia had to suffer great losses due to the war. There, Russian farmers and \nlabourers were recruited in the army in masses. It was done against their consent. \n",

There, Russian farmers and labourers were recruited in the army in masses. It was done against their consent.- 123 -\nAs a result, farming was disturbed because there were no experienced farmers. \nThe production of necessary items such as food, medicine, manure was disturbed \nbecause a majority of the factories were used for armament production. Because \nof that, there was a shortage of food in the country and food prices increased a lot. \nPeople suffered a lot because the price of bread went up. People were under pressure \nowing to the above reasons. It blasted in 1917. \n\uf076 Revolution in March, 1917\nThe March revolution in 1917 began with a strike in a textile factory. It grew into a \nmega strike within three days. All underprivileged groups gathered in this. People \nprotested along roads demanding for bread. Even the soldiers in Tsar\u2019s government \njoined these protests. The king had to give up his throne in March 1917 because he \ncould not control people\u2019s protests. After this, the administration power was taken \nby a group of rebels led by a leader called Kerensky. They too did not have solutions \nto the problems of the country. \nThe necessity of the country by that time was land for farmers, peace for soldiers and \nfood for all. Because of that, the farmers started to engage in subversive activities by \nsetting fire to lands, robbing and destroying the landowners. At the same time, the \nrulers of the new government worked in unison with capitalists going against the \nexpectations of the underprivileged. Soldiers too became disheartened because the \nnew government too continued the war. \n\uf076 Revolution in October 1917\nAt the same time, Bolsheviks under the leadership of Lenin worked with the aim of \ncreating a government of farmers and labourers by establishing organizations called \nSoviet Bureaus all over the country. There were two political groups as Bolsheviks \nand Mensheviks at the beginning of the Russian revolution. Mensheviks were the \nminority that believed that the problems of people can be solved through minor \nreforms. The majority were the Bolsheviks who believed in communism. Their \naim was to build a class free society based on communist ideas by breaking down \nthe capitalist economic system. This organization which was headed by Lenin and \nTrotsky received the support of underprivileged groups such as labourers, farmers, \nsoldiers etc. The temporary government which was established after the March \nrevolution, was disliked by the people because they could not solve the burning \nproblems of people.

This revolution \nwas supported by all but rulers. This proves how critical was the pressure felt by \nthe Russians. That is how they could win the revolution without much retaliation. \nAccording to the world accepted calendar the revolution took place in November, \nbut according to the calendar used in Russia it was October. Hence, this revolution \nbecame to be known as 1917 October revolution.  \n\uf076 The Results of the Revolution\nThe major result of this revolution is the establishment of a government by \nBolsheviks headed by Lenin by defeating the government led by Kerensky. The \nBolshevik party later became the Communist party. Lenin\u2019s government could \nend the war with Germany and bring peace to the country. Thus, Russia became a \npeaceful country.

The history does not know any war that invaded every continent before this. \nThis war began in Europe and later spread into their colonies also. Thereafter, when \nUnited States too joined the war, it became a world war that invaded all continents.\n\uf076 Reasons for World War I\n\u2022 France and Germany became enemies in the attempt of making a united \nGermany.\nThere was no country called Germany at the \nbeginning of the 19th century though there were \nabout 350 small states where people who spoke the \nGerman language. It was the skillful leader called \nOtto von Bismarck who created the country called \nGermany by making those small states united. \nBismarck established the united Germany in 1870 \nand started a war with France to show the strength \nof Germany. France suffered heavy losses in this \nwar.

German forces Fig 8.1 Otto von Bismarck Fig 8.2 German Emperor William II- 128 -\nwere strengthened in order to establish a German empire. Britain was distressed \nwith this fact and strengthened their forces in competition to Germany. Thus, there \nemerged a tensed situation in Europe. \n\u2022    Competition for colonies\nBy the mid 19th century the powerful countries in Europe had entered a competition \nof establishing colonies in Asia and Africa. Britain could claim the highest number \nof colonies here. The runners up were Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain and Holland.\nGermany that was able to achieve a rapid industrial development after the \nestablishment of a united Germany, wanted to find a market for their products. The \nother nations were suspicious about Germany\u2019s approach towards Asia and  Africa. \nSpecially, Britain took this as a challenge to their existing power. This competition \nfor colonies manured hostile feelings between powerful nations who were in \nopposition.\n\u2022    Competition for Armaments and Development of  Racism\nSince the latter part of the 19th century, every powerful country in Europe (Germany, \nBritain, France, and Russia) believed in being armed to increase their power. A \nGerman commander, Von Volk has said, \u201cyou will have to be armed for 50 years \nto protect what you have gained in 5 years by means of armaments.\u201d This shows \nthe dependence on armaments the Germans had. There was a competition for \narmament production among some European countries because they depended on \narmament production.\nOn the other hand, because Germany and Italy became united based on nationalism, \na nationalistic trend began to grow in Europe. A special characteristic in nationalism \nis that they treat their country in high regard considering other countries as inferior \nto them. This situation created problems among nations. \n\u2022    Foreign Policy of Bismarck that tried to isolate France in Europe\nBismarck of Germany who defeated France in war in 1870 captured the two fertile \nareas called Alsace and Lorraine that belonged to France.

A special characteristic in nationalism is that they treat their country in high regard considering other countries as inferior to them. This situation created problems among nations. \u2022 Foreign Policy of Bismarck that tried to isolate France in Europe Bismarck of Germany who defeated France in war in 1870 captured the two fertile areas called Alsace and Lorraine that belonged to France. Because of that Germany- 129 -\nwas always in fear that France would fight back in revenge and recapture Alsace \nand Lorraine. Therefore, the foreign policy of Germany after 1870 was building \nfriendship with powerful countries in Europe and working to isolate France in \nEurope. Two camps of countries emerged based on France and Germany in Europe \nbecause France too started building friendships with European nations. As a result \nof this, one camp was created by Germany, Austria and Italy and the other was built \nincluding Britain, France and Russia. Here, the camp including Germany was called \nthe central powers and the camp with France was called the Allied camp. The other \ncountries too joined one of these camps according to their necessities. Since then, \ntill 1914 there were verbal battles between these camps.\n\u2022 Assassination of Austria\u2019s Heir of Throne\nFig 8.3 \u2013 A picture depicting the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and his wife and \nthe vehicle they travelled\nWhen Europe was on the verge of a war, the heir to the throne in Austria, prince \nFranz Ferdinand and his wife were murdered when they were touring in Sarajevo, the \ncapital of Bosnia.

As a result, Germany declared war against Russia on the 01st of \nAugust 1914.\nBy that time France and Russia had been friendly countries and Germany which \nthought that France would support Russia because of their friendship declared war \nagainst France also with no second thoughts. There was a hatred between Germany \nand France since Germany was united. Germany thought of attacking France \nbefore she entered war and invaded Belgium and started attacking France through \nBelgium.

But within 20 years of the establishment \nof the League of the Nations Union, the convict of World War I, Germany began \nWorld War II also. It was clear that Nations Union\u2019s objective of stopping further \nwars could not be achieved. There were several reasons for this failure.\n\u2022 United States of America which was wealthy and a country with military power \ndid not become a member of this union. The American senate refused to agree with \nsome principles laid according to the requirements of the member countries of the \nLeague of the Nations Union. Therefore, a powerful country like America was not \nbound to protect the principles of the league of the Nations Union. This caused the \nfailure of the union. On the other hand keeping Russia, another powerful nation in \nthe world away from the league of the Nations Union too affected it badly.\n\u2022 The League of the Nations Union failed in encouraging its members to put its \ndecisions into action. The reason for that is because the union did not have such \npower to get its members function according to its decisions. There was no military \nforce in the union and there was no common agreement to employ a peace keeping \nforce.\n\u2022 Another challenge the union faced was that there was no unity among the powerful \nnations that were the members of the union and they were reluctant to give priority \nto common needs keeping their personal objectives aside. The members of the \nLeague of the Nations Union didn\u2019t pay enough attention to Germany\u2019s resignation \nfrom the union before World War II. The reason was that they were happy with \nGermany\u2019s role played in attacking communism. \n\u2022 The union was not able to work against some countries that disturbed world \npeace. When Italy invaded Abyssinia, economic restrictions were imposed against \nthem. Yet, the union failed to implement them efficiently.\n\u2022 Another example is the time Japan invaded Manchuria. No action was taken \nagainst Japan in this incident. \nThe result of the failure of  the League of the Nations Union was another World War. \nIt was World War II.\n",

World War II \nWe learned above that World War I ended by 1918 A.D. Another world war began to \nrise within two decades after  World War I. As a result, another world war occurred. \nThis devastating battle that lasted for six years from September 1939 to August 1945 \nis called  World War II.  \n\uf076 Reasons for World War II\nThough World War II began in 1939, it did not break out so suddenly. The \ncompetition that existed between powerful countries and the behaviour of some \nEuropean countries set the background for another war in about a decade after \nWorld War I. When this situation is considered, several reasons that kindled the war \ncan be identified. Let\u2019s study those in detail.\n01. Hitler's rise to power in Germany and his conduct \nAfter World War I, western countries got together to establish a new government in \nGermany which was called as \u201cWeimar Republic\u201d. The Failure of the Weimar \nRepublic in finding solutions to the problems faced by Germany in the contemporary \nsociety, paved way to a ruler like Hitler to come to power in Germany. Germany had \nto pay a vast compensation according to the Versailles convention. Because Germany \nspent her capital completely to pay compensation for war after 1920, the Weimar \nRepublic started printing money in large quantities. This created a high inflation in \nthe country reducing the real value of money. The price of goods went up rapidly \nand the unemployment rate too increased.

Hitler\u2019s followers took the advantage of- 136 -\nthis situation. Germany too suffered the adverse effects of the world economic \ndemise of 1929. As a result the prices of goods and unemployment rate increased in \nGermany. There were labour strikes in some cities. Though many countries faced \nthis situation, Hitler\u2019s followers began to claim that the democratic Weimar Republic \ncould not solve problems.\nAdolf Hitler was an Austrian. He fought for \nGermany in World War I. He was imprisoned during \nthe Weimar Republic for conspiring against the \ngovernment. While in prison, he wrote a famous \nbook called, \u201cMein Kampf (My War)\u201d. He presented \nhis ideas about German Nazism in this book. Hitler \nwho was released from prison kept on spreading an \ninsane racism. He was able to become the German \nChancellor by capturing the power in the German \nparliament (Reichstag) in 1933. His party was named \nas National Socialist Party. \nNazism\n\u2022 Nazism which emerged against democracy, communism, and capitalism, bore \n as its basic concept that Germans are the noblest  nation that descends from \n pure Aryans.\n\u2022 Another special characteristic of Nazism is looking down upon Jews.\n\u2022 Hitler has explained Nazism in his book \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019.\n\u2022 Nazism is a political system that was based on party dictatorship. \nIt is said that Hitler had conducted speeches before his instructors to get practice in \nmaking public speeches to attract people. He came to power in 1933 with the support \nof the other members in the parliament. Yet, he gradually established his power \nand started being a dictator. When Hitler became the chancellor, the president of \nGermany was Von Hindenburg. Old Hindenburg died soon and Hitler grasped the \npresident\u2019s power also.

Then he abolished all political Fig 8.6 Adolf Hitler- 137 -\nparties and started murdering his opponents such as communists and Jews. Here, \nhis secret police force, the Gestapo and the SS force engaged themselves in brutal \nmassacres. Hitler was a person who abused mass media completely for his advantage. \nHis media minister Goebbels, violated all media ethics and used mass media to \ncreate a public opinion which was partial to Hitler. Hitler completely disturbed the \ndemocracy of Germany. The freedom of press, freedom of meeting and freedom of \nexpressing ideas were completely banned. The contemporary Germans tolerated \nthese things with the expectation of a noble Germany as was promised by Hitler. The \nwestern capitalist countries did not oppose Hitler because they were happy about \nthe destruction caused to communism by Hitler\u2019s brutal massacres of communists \nin Germany. This apparently made Hitler more and more stubborn.      \n        \nHitler who quitted the League of the Nations Union in 1934 drew Germany back to \nwar. Hitler invaded neighbouring Austria in1938 and started a Nazi reign there by \nattaching it to Germany. Then, Hitler focused his attention on Czechoslovakia and \nby separating the Germans and Czechoslovakians, he supported the establishment \nof a new country called Sudetenland. After that, Hitler invaded both Sudetenland \nand Czechoslovakia and took them under the power of Germany. The western \ncountries did not oppose Hitler's actions till he invaded Poland. But with Hitler\u2019s \ninvasion of Poland, countries like Britain and France started fighting against Hitler. \nThat was the beginning of World War II. Hitler who came to power in 1933 started \nWorld War II by empowering Germany in 6 years and Allied forces including \nAmerica, England and Russia had to fight Hitler for 6 years to defeat him and wipe \nout Nazism from the world.\nDuring this period, Hitler had established concentration camps and got millions \nof innocent Jews and Russians assassinated.

The conduct of Mussolini in Italy Though Italy was in the victorious group in World War I, the peace pacts signed after war were not so profitable for them. They could not obtain the number of- 139 -\ncolonies they expected. As a result, there were several economic problems such as \nunemployment, food shortage etc. At the same time, labour strikes broke out because \nof increasing labour problems. Benito Mussolini who exploited this situation, \ncaptured political power through Fascist political party in 1922. His political \nsystem is known as Fascism. It is also a single party dictatorship like Nazism of \nHitler. Mussolini who captured power in Italy started hunting his enemies using the \narmed soldiers called \u2018Black Shirt Army\u2019. Though \nMussolini could strengthen the economy of Italy \nthrough dictatorship, his attempt became a failure \namidst the bad effects of world economic demise \nin 1929. First, Mussolini gathered all internal \npowers into his hand and later started spread the \npower of Italy internationally. It was in 1870 that \nItaly became a united country just as Germany. \nBy that time, the other European nations had \ncaptured many of the fertile areas of the world. As \na result, the existing condition was likely to create \nbattles among European nations in the attempt \nof Italy to establish colonies. In 1936, Mussolini \ninvaded and captured Abyssinia of Africa which is \nknown as Ethiopia today. Later Mussolini joined \nHitler in the World War II in order to improve Fascist power. There, the Fascist and \nNazi powers fought against the countries headed by England, Russia and America. \nMussolini was arrested towards the end of World War II and lost his life at the end.\n03. The conduct of Japan\nJapan came forward as a developed Asian country towards the end of the 19th century. \nThey had the necessity of finding raw materials for their productions and markets \nfor their products. Yet, by that time, many areas of Asia had become colonies of \nEuropean nations. Hence, Japan\u2019s attempt to fulfill its economic needs or building \na Japanese empire in Asia resulted in a situation which led Japan to have problems \nwith European nations. In 1934, Japan invaded Manchuria in Northern China and \ncaptured it. Japan\u2019s incursive behaviour was discussed in the League of the Nations \nUnion and Japan was found guilty of invasion. Here, Japan resigned from the League \nof the Nations Union and continued their invasive conduct by capturing several \n      Fig 8.9 Benito Mussolini\n",

Fig 8.14 Attack on the Pearl harbour- 144 -\n\uf076 Germany invading Russia\nAfter the above mentioned incidents, Hitler attacked Russia with no any clear \nreason. He thought that he would be able to capture Russia easily. The French \nemperor, Napoleon Bonaparte attacked Russia before this and retreated after a great \nloss with thousands of casualties. Hitler too faced a similar loss after 125 years. \nSoviet forces had foreseen such an attack and were ready to retaliate. So, they were \nwell equipped with all strategies to misguide the enemy. One such strategy was to \nkeep the German forces in Russia till the severe cold season approached. The Nazi \nforces too underwent the same destiny Napoleon\u2019s forces faced. German forces were \nnot prepared to face a long winter season. Therefore, severe coldness, food shortage \nand diseases caused many deaths among German forces. Hitler was not tactful \nenough to retreat. Ignorant to the critical conditions his forces were facing in Russia, \nHitler commanded them to move forward. There, the Russian red forces were able \nto defeat the German forces easily. \n\uf076 Germany surrenders\nRussia continued fighting and progressed towards Germany liberating the areas that \nwere in the hands of Nazis. At the same time, French and American forces launched \nattacks from the western front. The allied forces that reached Germany by March \n1945 came to Berlin by May. Hitler and many of his commanders, who understood \nthat their defeat was close by, committed suicide. Thus, Germany surrendered with \nno conditions in May 1945.\n\uf076 Japan surrenders\nJapan captured using its military power, the British colonies such as; Singapore, \nMalaysia, Burma, Hong Kong.
