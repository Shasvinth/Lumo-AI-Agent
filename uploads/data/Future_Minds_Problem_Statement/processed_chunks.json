    "text": "Ravi faces a daunting challenge: his history teacher assigns intricate questions based on the Grade 11 History textbook. With so many commitments on his plate, Ravi simply doesn\u2019t have the time to pore over every detail in the thick textbook. One afternoon, as Ravi struggles to balance his workload, inspiration strikes. What if he could create an application that could read and understand the entire textbook and then answer his teacher\u2019s questions on demand? Inspired by his need for quick and reliable information, he embarks on a journey to create an intelligent chatbot. This digital assistant harnesses the power of \nadvanced AI techniques to retrieve and synthesize key details from historical \ndocuments into clear, helpful responses. Throughout his adventure, Ravi refines his \nsystem by incorporating multiple collaborating agents\u2014each with a distinct role\u2014to \nemulate human-like decision-making and streamline the process of learning from a \ncomplex text. \n2. Problem Statement \nDesign and develop a chatbot that consists of multiple agents collaborating to solve \nuser queries about a given document. The chatbot should simulate intelligent \ndecision-making by dividing responsibilities based on the nature of the task. At a \nminimum, it must include a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent capable of \nidentifying and retrieving relevant information from the document and generating \ncoherent, context-aware answers. \nParticipants are encouraged to expand the chatbot\u2019s functionality by adding additional \nagents such as task planners, summarizers, translators, sentiment analyzers, etc that \nwork in concert to enhance its overall performance. Whether you choose a no-code \nsolution using Langflow\u2019s drag-and-drop interface or decide to incorporate code for \nadditional functionality, the primary goal is to create an innovative tool that mirrors \nRavi\u2019s vision: transforming a vast amount of historical content into interactive, easily \naccessible knowledge. \nBy tackling this challenge, you will explore the intersection of education and technology, \ndemonstrating how AI-powered multi-agent systems can revolutionize the way we \naccess and understand historical knowledge. \n \n \n \n",
