Even the vehicles that carry heavy loads of goods and passengers could be driven 
fast and easily on these roads. Therefore, hundreds of miles of such roads were built 
in Britain and Scotland within a short period.
Machines and engines used for transport too developed with the development of 
roads. The production of the steam engine by George Stephenson in 1814 became a 
landmark in the industrial revolution. As a result, trains could be used to transport 
coal and other products. The time spent for transport could be minimized by 
transporting products from factories to markets and transportation cost was 
reduced by being able to transport heavy loads of goods at a time. It is believed that 
George Stephenson who invented the locomotive engine was not able to read and 
write till he was 17 years old.

produced the safety lamp in 1812. In 1839, a method was found to take coal out of the mines using iron cables instead of the old method of taking them out by women and children using copper cables. The development of the coal industry resulted in several by products. Tar obtained by burning coal was used in road construction. Paints that were necessary in dyeing clothes too were made with the help of coal. It was further used to produce medicine, perfumes, oil and fertilizers.

Expansion of  the Industrial Revolution  
The industrial revolution that took place in the fields of textile, coal and iron 
industries in Britain soon spread into the other fields also.  When the nature of this 
expansion is considered, two types of expansions can be identified as expansion of 
industrial revolution to other fields and expansion of industrial revolution to other 
countries.
1.  Expansion to other fields
The new knowledge that emerged in relation to industrial and technological fields as 
a result of industrial revolution did not limit itself to industries and productions. It 
spread to the other fields too. Fields like transport, communication and agriculture 
too had rapid development under the influence of the industrial revolution.
 �Expansion of transportation   
Many changes took place in the transport sector because of the influence of the 
industrial revolution. With the development of the industrial sector, a necessity 
of developing a road system arose for transporting raw materials to factories and 
transporting products to markets. Therefore in 1811, John McAdam introduced a 
new way of making roads. It is called “the Macadam Method.”


for exporting • Introduction of Macadam method to build roads in 1885 There was a need for manpower for the estates and factories and the labour class was formed by the people who worked there for salary. Landowners and factory owners became the affluent class and they organized themselves separately as a wealthy, educated middle class. The capitalist economic system grew in Sri Lanka and import and export trade held a prominent place. The necessity of a banking system was felt in order to handle financial transactions between countries in import and export. So, banks were started in Sri Lanka.- 18 -
The transport system had to be developed in order to carry the estate products to 
trade centres and the harbour in Colombo and supply necessities to estates. Up to 
this time transportation was done by means of carts. Because it was not so efficient, 
roads and railways were introduced. The Colombo - Kandy road was constructed 
during the time of the governor, Edward Barns. Thereafter, roads to Kandy were built 
from Kurunegala and Dambulla. After that, the system of constructing roads using 
stones and tar was started. Further, the wood bridges that existed over water ways 
were replaced by iron bridges. The governor, Henry Ward started laying railways. 
The construction of the Kandy railway was started in 1858 and was completed in 
1863. In August 1867, a train service was started from Colombo to Kandy for the 
first time. After that it was extended from Peradeniya to  Nawalapitiya in 1871 and 
up to Bandarawela in 1899.
With the development of roads and transportation, trade centres were started and 
they expanded to cities. Gampola, Badulla, Ratnapura and Matale are such cities 
beyond Colombo that were populated during this time. Sending messages was done 
through a messenger up to this time. An official postal system had been started 
by 1815 connecting the cities like Colombo, Trincomalee, Galle, Kandy and Jaffna. 
This was carried out using chariots. Thus, running chariots was started for the first 
time in Asia, in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka’s first postal stamp was issued in 1857. By 
1903, 340 post offices had been opened around the country. The telegram service 
was started in 1858.

treaty was signed between the Dutch and the English, allowing the Dutch to leave the country peacefully, avoiding a further loss for them. This was signed on February 16th. With that the coastal areas which were in the hands of the Dutch fell into the hands of the English.  Governance of the Coastal Areas under the East Indian Trade Company When the Portuguese and the Dutch ruled the coastal belt of Sri Lanka, they had organized the administration well using native officers as much as possible. Yet, the English Trade Company did not understand this. Therefore the English hired- 25 -
officers from the Madras government and governed the parts they captured under 
Madras rulers. This lasted from 1796 to 1798. 
A Resident was appointed to Sri Lanka under the Madras administration to rule the 
coastal areas of Sri Lanka. A group of assistant supervisors was appointed under the 
Resident to collect income and they were named as collectors. Their service centre 
was named as Kachcheri. That was how the Kachcheri system was started in Sri 
Lanka. Another group of officers was appointed in assistance to the collectors who 
were called as Avumildars. More officers were there to help the Avumildars and all 
these groups were engaged in collecting income under the supervision of collectors.
 
The local officers like Mudliers were ignored in the English administration. People 
were brought from Madras for the above posts and those who came from Madras 
did not have any knowledge about the local languages, culture and traditions. The 
relationship between the general public and the administrative officers became 
distanced because such a group of officers was appointed for the civil administration, 
legal system and income collection. 
The India Trade Company had spent a lot of money in capturing the coastal belt of 
Sri Lanka. Another significant feature of the British administration is their attempts 
to cover the above mentioned cost and to achieve fast profits.  They imposed several 
new taxes in the coastal areas to meet the above target. People in the coastal areas 
were in trouble when they had to pay those taxes in cash. One such example is the 
newly introduced ‘tax on coconut trees.’ Thus, someone who owned more than 10 
coconut trees had to pay a tax of one silver panam (six cents) for each coconut tree. 
People were irritated because the tax was charged without considering the nature of 
the harvest and they had to pay it in cash.  This soon became an insurgency due to 
the repugnance of the general public towards the new administration. This rebellion 
that began in 1797 against the India Trade Company extended to all coastal areas 
quickly. This was suppressed after much effort by the British. This insurgency gave 
evidence to the fact that there was much resistance to the English administration 
at its very beginning. Therefore, a commission was appointed to look into the 
situation of the coastal areas and suggest changes. This commission was named as 
Meuron commission after the name of Brigadier General De Meuron who headed 
the commission.
Some proposals of the Meuron Commission;

system and the duty labour system were banned by the Colebrooke Commission. The building and maintenance of lakes, bunds, canals and dams of each area were done by the Gam Sabha (village council). The major method the Gam Sabha got labour was the system called ""duty labour"". Yet, when this method was cancelled, the Gam Sabha found it difficult to get necessary labour forces. The Gam Sabha did a good service by solving the minor problems in the area. But, they lost their judiciary power due to the reforms in 1833. The villagers had to suffer due to such reasons.- 38 -
New Judiciary System
Villagers had to go to courts even for a small matter according to Cameron’s legal 
reforms. Earlier, they could get such matters resolved in their villages. They were 
not aware either of the English language or the rules and regulations that were in 
function in the new courts. Some other problems the villagers had to face were that 
they had to pay all lawyers’ charges, stamp fees in cash and had to spend days in the 
court when they went for legal matters. As a result, their agricultural work including 
the protection of their cultivations was neglected.
Distancing Relationship between the People and the Government
The decisions to reduce the number of civil service posts and allowing the civil 
servants to engage themselves in estate cultivation following the Colebrooke 
recommendations, made the local administration inefficient. As a result, the area 
of the administration officer expanded and they found it difficult to supervise such 
a big area. Because some officers were more attentive on cultivation, they did not 
have enough time to attend to the needs of the people. As a result, the problems of 
the general public were not properly informed to the government and it affected to 
widen the relationship between the people and the government.
The New Tax Policy of the Government
The closest reason for the struggle was the decision of the governor, Sir Torrington 
to impose new taxes in 1848. Because the government income had gone down, the 
governor made a tax reform with the purpose of earning a considerable sum from 
the people. A stamp fee, cart and catamaran tax, tax on shops, tax on guns, body tax, 
and tax on dogs were those new taxes. People opposed all those taxes; especially the 
protest against the taxes on guns, body and dogs was significant. 
The villagers used guns to protect their cultivations. They had to pay two shillings 
and a half every year for the tax on guns. The villagers had to go to government 
offices for this and to fill in the forms in English language. They had to pay 
extra charges in addition to the time spent. Charges they had to pay for the guns 
sometimes exceeded the real value of the guns. There was a resistance for the tax on 
guns because of the above reasons. 
Every grown up male had to work in building roads for six days every year and 
if they failed to do so they had to pay three shillings as a tax on their body. There 
was opposition for this tax also. People had to pay taxes for dogs in 1848. This was 
","The Macadam method, introduced by John McAdam in 1811, is a road-building technique involving the spreading of small pieces of granite on a strong foundation of larger stones and soil.  The road surface was then pounded and leveled. This method allowed even heavy vehicles to travel quickly and easily, leading to the construction of hundreds of miles of roads in Britain and Scotland within a short time.
